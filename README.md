# Insight The Witcher: Data Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project delves into the rich world of The Witcher series (books, games, and TV show) through data analysis and visualization. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights from various datasets related to characters, events, lore, and fan reception. **A central focus is the dedicated sentiment analysis on fan reception of The Witcher Season 3, aiming to quantify and visualize the depth of negative sentiment and key thematic complaints.** This project demonstrates foundational data science skills in acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visual storytelling.

## Features
* **Deep Sentiment Analysis on The Witcher Season 3 Reception:** Utilizing custom models (or robust libraries) to classify, score, and quantify the level of negative sentiment from fan reviews and social media comments.
* **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Gathering data from public sources (APIs, web scraping) related to characters, lore, and review texts, followed by standardization and preprocessing.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discovering patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data using statistical methods.
* **Comparative Visualizations:** Creating visuals that contrast fan perception of Season 3 against previous seasons or other related media.
* **Key Insights Generation:** Identifying specific pain points and critical themes driving fan dissatisfaction.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For creating static and statistical visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and presentation of findings.
* *(Optional - add if you used them):* **NLTK / Scikit-learn:** For Natural Language Processing tasks.
