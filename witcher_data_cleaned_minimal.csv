rd52w1,hnzg1e1,"Ready to get downvoted to hell, but as someone who watched the show with no prior knowledge to the Witcher universe I bloody loved it, I then started the books (only read the short stories and blood of elves so far) and rewatched it recently in prep for season two, I still thought it was great! Yes things were changed and the timeline jumps could have been handled better, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. So I have very high hopes for season two if all of the reviews seem better already!
Admittedly I'm not as invested in the Witcher universe as some of you guys here are, so I appreciate why the changes in the adaptation don't bother me as much. For comparison, His Dark Materials is one of my favourite book trilogies ever, and the show frustrated me to no end and made me angry at all the things they missed, so I completely understand the backlash about season one.

In that case the WITCHER series would start purely with 2 episodes of Yen, then 4 episodes of Yen+Geralt, and Ciri would be introduced in the last 2 episodes.

I'm not glorifying the show or anything, but all together, the books, games, and season one create a beautiful story in such a rich fantasy world.

The world and story I personally want to dive into more than GoT. Liked that show too! but it's so different I hate that comparison being used everywhere... High fantasy vs. low fantasy...

No point on showing Ciri from the start if she only meets a main character at the end. There is this thing.....quality over quantity ;)   


You barely ever see Ciri during the first 2 books. But when she is around, the quality is so much that.....she shines!!!! And her connection with Geralt gives you absolutely no room for questions. Their set up together is so strong in the books that you just cant possibly miss it. Its like being hit with an emotional sledge hammer. It comes late in the 2nd book but when it comes.....it hits you with everything the author has.

rd52w1,ho0efcz,"Because we have a show, which is about witcher - monster hunter, who travels across the Continent. If you start the show with 2 episodes of Yennefer - the audience will not watch it. This is similar to starting the GoT with a storyline of wildlings, and then randomly showing ""hey, there is actually a kingdom behind this wall"". There are characters, which can be introduced later on. For Ciri, for example, I wouldn't mind if Geralt just randomly met her in Brokilon, as he actually did in books, and then brought her back to Cintra, or whatever. But still, to better understand the connection between her and Geralt, she needs to appear in more then just few scenes. But then you get last 2 episodes being just Ciri, and almost no Geralt.

1ompkyd,nmsbta6,"I honestly think the ‘mistakes’ made in season 2 have allowed them to progress the story more effectively in ways. The books unfortunately aren’t perfect, and it would have been really challenging to create the necessary depth of character relationships without it. 

We unfortunately needed some conjunction lore (because it’s not really fleshed out in the books well enough), so creating physical evidence for it makes sense; and the introduction of the wild hunt and their connections to it needed to be introduced. It also created the connection between the Aen Sidhe and the Aen Elle, and their opposition to one another. 

Yen and Ciri going from Melitele where Yen gently bullied Ciri, to them suddenly being ‘mother-daughter’ made little sense as it didn’t clearly delineate that Yen didn’t want to control her for her own ends; the change with the whole baba yaga arc, as unfaithful as it was, set the scene for that, and made it clear that Yen’s priorities had shifted, and she prioritised family through her own sacrifice, which also set the grounds for her reasoning behind wanting to create the lodge (dismantling patriarchal power structures in the magical community); further, it also shows why Ciri is so devastated by thinking they are both dead as she’s lost all the family she has known to date, which better explains why, in her grief, she joins the rats, and why, despite their betrayal, she returns to them to try to save them (and inevitably loses yet another family). 


Were they choices that could have been made differently? Sure, but with limited time to introduce things over a short episode span, I get it.  Unfortunately the books have so many moving pieces, some of which are randomly thrust upon as at the end of the story, that they needed to make them make sense early on, so when they are introduced there is some consistency.

1ompkyd,nmseh63,"My criticism of season 2 is less focused on the fact that they tried to expand on existing relationships and storylines. In principle, that was absolutely the right decision, because just as you say, the books don’t give us outright content about everything but many things are implied. When it comes to Yen‘s and Ciri‘s relationship for example, in the chapter of the book about their time in Ellander there are many implications upon which they could have built more depth to their characters.

My point is that the books don‘t expand on everything (as you said, they aren‘t perfect) but they deliver us all the tools we need to build more. Sadly, the decision was made to not use those tools and build something completely different without any footing in the source material or even outright contradict some if not much of it.

That is already an absolute no-go in my opinion, but objectively that‘s not an inherently bad thing. Odyssey was also a good video game, just not a good Assassin‘s Creed game (just if you‘re familiar with the franchise). Even if it was their opinion that they needed to create something of their own to give the characters and the story more depth, they could have done a lot better.

As perhaps hinted at above, I loved Yennefer's story the most. Anya Chalotra I found fantastic as Yen, but alas I cannot really say all I want to with that.

There are three....threads of this story, again I must be careful, and these three threads all have a lead, no surprises for guessing that these three are Geralt, Cirilla, and Yen. I won't say any more about that for now.

I will say that Cirilla is great thus far, Yen is great thus far and then we get to Cavill as Geralt, who I was not keen on when he was cast. I have to say I am warming to Cavill, I really am, but before I fully decide I want to see certain changes that I expect from his character as Season 1 goes on. I would also say with regards to spoilers, if you know the books and the games, then the biggest spoilers will be things you are expecting anyway.

I love the score, the aesthetics, the performances, the grittiness of a truly horrible world, and the monsters of which I cannot name are really quite scary and dark. The fight choreography, is excellent so far, despite the slowed down  piss takes that have done the rounds from the trailer. (can't help watching that guy just shaking his friends head around from that one shot, even on the show, thanks internet). However, in full speed it works and Geralt is lethal.

For me, this is like Game of Thrones with less leads and more magic. If any fans of Game of Thrones watch this, they will enjoy it, because it does feel so grounded. (oh and a quick nod out to Queen Calanthe, she kicks ass)

Season 2 left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Went into season 3 with an open mind, but I feel like it’s struggling to play catch up to get everything where it needs to be in terms of relationships, characters, locations, etc because just season 2 skipped all of that for whatever was that plot. 

I’m fine with adapting and changing as needed, but overall everything feels sloppily executed. 

A lot of the dialogue feels lazy. Fuck is one of my favorite words and I use it way more than I should, but the show beats me by a lot. 

It feels like a big misunderstanding of what the story is supposed to be, by that I mean the twisting of fairy tails and tropes to be different.

I can hardly tell one location to the next, everything feels/looks pretty generic other than the wide shots of Thanedd. I’ll praise game of thrones for each region looking and feeling different, not just the location but the people too.

Like it if you want, but to claim that a show that has been overall subpar so far is according to you ranked among the best fantasy shows...it says more about the thirst for high fantasy genre than anything else. Ever thought of that?For what it is, right now, it is forgettable.

The books are also inferior to the videogame. Not only inferior, but much less popular. So as a result, the work that popularized the franchise by following the adventures of Geralt, is right now focusing on the thing that people cared less about: royal political intrigue. It was interesting in the videogame, but it was never the main focus. It was all about the emotional encounters. The multiple side quest stories about what defines a monster. This what made people fall in love with The Witcher.

Not the books. Not the mutilated version that is this tv show that adapts neither.

There is no protagonist so far, that's how bad this is when all people want is Geralt. Instead we get to watch a bunch of characters that add nothing because production thought they could pull a GoT out of this.

Regardless, this criticism is valid, even though I don't particularly care about it, here's why, .

We never really see those dreams affect her day to day, we don't see any fear or distress which makes it bizarre that she wants to kill this guy so badly. Keep in mind that her experience with this guy is killing some knight she doesn't know and taking her away from the massacre in Cintra before getting free.

It's a plot point the writers ripped from the books but completely failed to adapt even though none of their changes would have prevented them from doing so properly.

edi147,fbiw9ly,"I'm only three episodes in, so this is more like my first impressions comment.

I'm watching the Witcher with my husband, who has played the games and is in the process of reading the books. I, on the other hand, have very little knowledge of this world and who's who in it.

So far, we have both been frustrated with the pacing. I'm trying my best to understand what is going on and what sort of world is being painted in front of us, but I feel I'm just not given enough time to take it all in. It has been a confusing experience so far for me.

The multiple timelines makes sense now in regards to why my husband is confused, because he is constantly commenting on how the timeframe for events does not fit... the multiple timeline as a narrative device hasn't clicked for him yet, so yes, he is still trying to fit the story into a linear storytelling mode. 

My husband as a viewer is not inexperienced, so perhaps he just hasn't watched enough ""non linear material"". I, also, am an experienced viewer, and my taste in films, books and TV shows has given me enough time to get used to timelines jumping and what not. Not to mention I have a degree in the field (art education). But... I would have not understood on my own what's going on with the storytelling had I not come here.

We have had lengthy conversations about the show after each episode, which talks in favour of the Witcher, it does spark an interest, but I feel it demands a little too much from its viewer, knowledgeable in its lore or not. At least in its first three episodes. Or perhaps I'm not smart enough for this show? We'll see. The problem may be that most ""casual people"" might just end up giving up on the show.

I will definitely read the books now, my husband explained a lot of lore and backstory whenever I fell off the wagon... Which was quite often :P The world of the Witcher seems rich and dynamic, and what little I am familiar with now, Geralt to Ciri is kind of like what Han Solo is to Luke Skywalker? 

My husband and I will probably finish watching the season today, and I'm quite looking forward to it. I just hope either the show slows down a bit, or I pick up my watching game, because I have felt slightly stoopid so far.

3. The role may have some degree of burn out. The Witcher has had lots of several months long on location shoots, with getting Covid and Henry sustaining injuries during the shoots and having to dehydrate himself at times he may just want to give himself to something more comfortable.

4. There could be personal drama between him and the producers/writers/crew/cast but Henry seems pretty genuinely nice so I think this is unlikely, and he does dwarf them all in terms of influence and talent.

Losing your lead like this suggests either someone fucked up big time on contracts, or there's something else going in the background.

Curious to see how Netflix reacts to this, and I assume we'll get more information soon. Or we should anyway. Him leaving is going to overshadow any marketing and promotion they do for Season 3. Got no opinion on Liam as an actor, but even if he kills it, the transition is going to be incredibly jarring regardless.

They're gonna need to do a *little* better than that. The fact that they're already committed to S4 does tell you Netflix is still heavily invested on the series.

Also the timing on this could have been better. This is going to overshadow Blood Origins IMO, so my speculative side says this its something major driving this change.

S2 devolved into some pretty unforgivable character transgressions:

1. Vesimir would \*never\* agree to make Ciri a Witcher...especially without even talking with Geralt about it.
2. Yennefer would \*never\* sell Ciri to a demon, or whatever that garbage was.  They absolutely ruined the whole relationship between the two.
3. They ruined Yennefer's character.  She was less mature, savvy, powerful Yen and more Angsty 20'something Zenniel with a potty mouth.  Such a departure from the books and game.  It made some sense (and she was less...dumb(?)) in S1, but it got so much worse in S2.

I was not hopeful for S3, but would've watched it and given it a chance.  Henry leaving the show, as passionate as he was about the role and the world, is so significant.  I believe it means they continued with disrespecting the lore, making idiotic changes to characters.  Without Henry carrying the show.  With Beau DeMayo's confirmation that there were writers that actively disliked the books and games, and learned that he would hire only true fans of an IP moving forward....says so much.

I have zero interest in it and won't watch S3 or S4 or S5.  I'm sad for Ciri & Jaskier, because they were doing great jobs in her roles.  (Edited as a kind poster reminded me of what a gem Jaskier is in S1!) :)

ygrul3,iuag0bv,"Not to give it the ole “I told you so” but…the signs were very much there that this production is all over the place. The recent leak for one thing. But when [this article](https://gamerant.com/henry-cavill-the-witcher-return-condition/) came out last year, which quotes him as saying “he's willing to come back to The Witcher for its entire long run as long as the showrunners continue making high-quality programming” I just knew that was HC’s very unsubtle way of saying if he ever dips it will be because of the show’s rapid nosedive in quality. Everyone knew this was a passion project for him, he’s a massive fan of the franchise and wanted to do this adaptation justice. As disappointing as this news is, it’s not a surprise when you consider how much the show has deviated from the books, and not for the better.

ygrul3,iubtsti,"Cavill's notes about Geralt were so right, and it's also that Cavill pushed to get the role and volunteered to take a big paycut to fully realise and play a character he loved in a series he was a big fan of, and his input was very faithful to the character and story, and if the Witcher producers knew anything better (except Declan DeBarra who is excellent and had great ideas for the adaptation), they would have listened to this star-power who was drawing in the audience in the first place. 

But instead, we saw Geralt's screentime progressively reduce and his lines taken away, turning him into a one dimensional character that he isn't. The show diluted the essence of the books, that is Sapkowski taking a stereotypical lone-wolf rugged grunt of a mutant hero archetype and deconstructing him and exploring the humanity in him that everyone claimed he didn't have, and bringing in great insight about the observational skills he had having spent so long travelling the continent and meeting all kinds of people, which was a reflection of Sapkowski's experience as a polyglot economist who had travelled the world. 

The showrunners assumed Sapkowski's work was limited when it wasn't to begin with, and they almost completely sidelined Geralt from the get go when it really should have been that Geralt and his short stories should have been adapted almost as is to highlight the working class, countryside old world folk tales that they really were, exploring philosophical themes in a meditative fashion, and once Geralt was fully established and explored as his own person, introducing the final stage of his character which was through Ciri. They didn't need to establish other characters from the get-go, they just had to follow the books as they were written and streamline them a little to fit a screenplay. Sapkowski had already written them in a very episodic fashion.  

There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the themes and intentions of the books, and the sense of cultural exploration that they evoked with political intrigue and satire. Such a shame.

ygrul3,iuci23h,"Man, I understand the complaints about season 2 and I do share them to some degree but the collective reaction from the internet that he resigned because of the showrunnes and direction the show took leaves me baffled a little. 

I don't buy this argument. S2 was bad but it was far from ""bastardization"" some are suggesting. Besides - a superfan like him would NEVER leave the role. Playing the character you've been nerding out for years and getting paid for it? That's a dream job for many. You don't resign from this, like its nothing. 

This is money and better opportunities speaking. Dude's back to playing Superman and potentially the next James Bond so good for him. But tbh, all this talk from him about being Superfan and how he's in for a long run just kind of makes him look bad, when he resigned as soon as the first offer came up (the timing doesn't work for him here). 

Either way this sucks. Press promotion for S3 will be a hoot, rest of the cast will start to hate him pretty quickly after they'll be forced to answer questions about his departure over and over.

Liam is wrong for the part, lacks the ability, and is boarding a sinking ship because the series has already been going downhill from the start, with last season pissing a lot of people off.

ygrul3,iuax0uo,"Honestly the story deviations were only one of my criticisms of season 2. I maybe could’ve lived with them if the rest of the season wasn’t also so bad.

-Sloppy editing and adherence to realism. People literally travel across the entire Continent in less than a day. Yennefer, when escaping from Cahir’s execution, steals a single horse, standing alone, that happens to be saddled and ready to go. Magic is used near Cintra, and like a second later a team of horsemen is already half a mile outside the city gates riding for Yennefer and Ciri (who are promptly saved by Geralt and the dwarves swooping in and saving the day with impossibly perfect timing). 

-Way too many forced monster fights and action sequences, not enough quieter character interactions. Jesus fucking Christ, they literally came out and said that they tried to have a big monster battle every single episode in order to keep people engaged. It’s downright insulting to suggest that your audience is a bunch of a children who need big bad poorly-rendered CGI monster battles every thirty minutes or else they’ll get bored. 

-The pacing is fucking atrocious. Most of the episodes, especially near the end, feel incredibly rushed and chaotic. This was one of basically everybody’s biggest complaints about season 1, but I thought it would be resolved in season 2 because they had a lot less ground to cover. But nope, it feels like every episode is amped up on fifty grams of amphetamine and just keeps introducing more and more characters and plot points without giving them the proper screen time. Where are we? Who the fuck is this? Jesus, just let the show breathe every now and then. It wouldn’t kill you to have a few episodes that are slow-paced; that one HBO show that you’re desperately trying to resemble was able to get away with it all the time, at least in the earlier seasons.

-Bland music. None of the tracks stood out to me like they did in season one. They just blended into the background.

-Terrible dialog. It feels so, so campy. Literally like a CW show. Stiff and fake-sounding at best and downright annoyingly cringy at worst. I will fling myself off a bridge if I hear “fire fucker” one more time.",25,2022-10-30 05:42:36,honestly story deviations one criticisms season maybe couldve lived rest season wasnt also bad sloppy editing adherence realism people literally travel across entire continent less day yennefer escaping cahirs execution steals single horse standing alone happens saddled ready go magic used near cintra like second later team horsemen already half mile outside city gates riding yennefer ciri promptly saved geralt dwarves swooping saving day impossibly perfect timing way many forced monster fights action sequences enough quieter character interactions jesus fucking christ literally came said tried big monster battle every single episode order keep people engaged downright insulting suggest audience bunch children need big bad poorlyrendered cgi monster battles every thirty minutes else theyll get bored pacing fucking atrocious episodes especially near end feel incredibly rushed chaotic one basically everybodys biggest complaints season thought would resolved season lot less ground cover nope feels like every episode amped fifty grams amphetamine keeps introducing characters plot points without giving proper screen time fuck jesus let show breathe every wouldnt kill episodes slowpaced one hbo show youre desperately trying resemble able get away time least earlier seasons bland music none tracks stood like season one blended background terrible dialog feels campy literally like cw show stiff fakesounding best downright annoyingly cringy worst fling bridge hear fire fucker one time,-0.05618034447821681,0.5350050658561297

ygrul3,iuccd2p,">Vesimir would \*never\* agree to make Ciri a Witcher...especially without even talking with Geralt about it.

That was something that, even having only watched the show... I was totally confused by. Vesimir comes across as traumatized from having turned/raised kids as Witchers. I also felt like (maybe it maybe Vesimir's actor?) he viewed the remaining Witchers as essentially sons.

So when Ciri wants to be a Witcher, first Geralt definitely would not be onboard. Vesimir says so. Even if he was a guy who came across as desperate to make more Witchers (he didn't to me), Ciri makes no sense. 

First, she's basically Geralt's kid and Vesimir acts more like a grandpa to her and does respect Geralt, so even if he wanted to try to turn her... he would wait the literal less than a day Geralt was gone. Like they were acting like it needed to be done right that minute and like he had wrestled with going behind Geralt's back... he was gone 12 hours!

It could be that I'm so wrapped up in what I've read/played that I just can't see 'good' character decisions ... but you seal it for me.  If you, having not seen or read the source material, feel the same way then I think the onus is on the writing, and not our perceptions.

And you're absolutely right about Vesimir being a 'grandfatherly' figure to Ciri.  That's part of the whole dynamic of Geralt, Yen, Ciri and Vesimir (and the other Witchers)...a big ""Found family"" in a huge world that is cold and uncaring, but these disparate folks come together and create a family of their own.  S2 destroys the mother/daughter like bond that Ciri and Yen are supposed to have.  The whole ""elder blood making Witchers"" is an extremely goofy plot line (and not at all what comes from the source material).  Only 30% of those given the Trial of the Grasses survive...taking that risk with the only source of Elder blood is....sorry to say it, fucking DUMB.  Their own plot point is silly, and the decisions made because of it are even dumber.  ugh.  So, again, your perceptions are keen that this is a bad idea and doesn't make any sense whatso ever. :(

There is a Youtuber...xLetalisx that does tons and tones of Witcher 3 videos, and he has story playthroughs where you can watch the story from start to finish.  I daresay that if you're not into playing through the games yourself, these might be worth a watch to get a feel for the characters and the world as imagined by CDPR.  They're not 100% 'by the book' (indeed, the  game happens after the books) but the characters are brilliant and the stories are gripping and well written.

Personally, I get used to the fact that another actor plays a character pretty quickly, but I understand how weird it is in the first moments you watch it, especially when you get used to the appearance of the other main characters. I wonder how it will affect the series itself, maybe on the other hand it will be a bit refreshing and make people out of sheer curiosity to watch the new actor on? Or vice versa xD (I hope not)

However, the problem is also that Liam Hemsworth will have a hard time building this character his own way because Cavill's version has become an iconic, so I hope it won't end up with the new actor imitating Cavill but also introducing something new.

At one level, someone like Liam does work better than Cavil so far as the romance side of things are concerned. Cavil has always looked way too old for Anya IMO, so seeing them together has always been a little off. Liam *looks* closer to her in age, in part because he has softer features.

I guess this might not be the most popular opinion but Blood of Elves is not a good book. At least when it comes to making a tv show for casual audiences. It’s pretty boring.

Very little monster hunting (I recall just one brief fight at the river?) and a lot about Triss shitting herself haha.

Regardless of what happened. S2 was ultimately going to have to change some stuff for general audiences cause if it bombed… the shows over. Doesn’t matter how faithful it is if casual audiences get bored and stop watching. Netflix will axe it.

I don’t think all the choices made were great ones. But I also fully accept changes had to be made. What works as a book is not always going to work as a tv show. That said the following books are way better when it comes to being adapted. So we’ll see how S3 and beyond (if it gets that) goes.

ql2kj6,hj4zg10,"As for stuff you might not remember from the books, 

. Yen showed up to save Jaskier and its severely implied she is working to try and find out what´s going on. She seems to be working as some kind of spy. She is also in touch with Dijkstra and Phillipa which comes from her conversation with Jaskier. So, Yen was at least in contact with Phillipa´s faction and aware of their doings (if not somewhat participating till a certain point in time) 

. Somewhere Yen got promoted into the Council of Magic. So no doubt she has been in great contact with most influential northern magic users. 

The books leave it open if Vilgefortz ever tried approaching Yen. Its a bit unlikely. Vilgefortz seems to have been very aware that he needed to hide from Tissaia and Yen is Tissaia´s right hand. I suspect Tissaia, Yen and likely Rita were all not approached by Vilgefortz and remained neutral. Together with a couple more people, they were the peaceful faction, the optimistic ones, who did not really want to see the real problems. 

Which all works into what happened at Thaned. And it works into Yen asking Ciri to forgive her for all their poor calculations and idealistic attempts.

Besides, even if every Sodden survivor, for some reason, was silent we already saw Foltest (and the Northern Kingdoms armies, as implied by Triss). This means Foltest and co. know Tissaia was among the leaders there.

Artorius and Stregobor can't play the pacifists now (at best, pressing for a truce on the Northern Kingdoms' terms). They could accuse Tissaia for the mages' deaths, but when the North see the Sodden's mages as heroes it should be Tissaia's party to have the bigger influence. The worst scenario is not Tissaia and the war heroes being sanctioned, but a split of the Brotherhood between so-called pacifists and the interventionists (and the split is unlikely, knowing how Thanedd will unfold).

At Garstang she lifts the magical block because she thinks it's only Phil's party to having schemed and plotted...unfortunately, what in her mind should have been a way to put everyone on the same level again and calm the situation down allows to Vilg's party, that schemed even better, to gain the upper hand with Isengrim's commandos, Rience and Cahir.

Besides, the chances of two different parties knowing Ciri travels with Geralt is quite low, so Stregobor could really be the show version of Artaud and being a partner of Vilg. In short, either he is into Vilg/Nilfgaard camp or he works alone - which makes his role even more short-lived than book Artaud.

There is also the sheer timeline thing. 

Yen is supposed to be close to 90 years old or something. By all bits of info within the books, she was trained at Aretuza during her teens. So that places Tissaia there like 70 years in the past. Which....is a lot of time!!! 

It makes sense that the school is not some kind of dictatorship for life. Actually, a school should always be looking to include the next generation and get new staff. So they will be more updated and open for new things. 

In the books they discuss a bit about social rules and they kind of complain that Tissaia was too strict. It could well be that the whole society evolved a bit in the span of 50 years or more. Its actually quite predictable that a new generation will brake some of the established rules and change stuff their own way.

Somehow, Thanedd wouldn't feel as dramatic without Tissaia having a mental breakdown in that moment and undoing the spell, as everyone yells at each other around her.

As for the layout, there seems to be an entire castle/complex on top of the school which I think is what Garstang is supposed to be in the show's version - we saw it very clearly in the new trailer - my guess is, it's probably where both the banquet and the coup will happen.

Logistically, that's also where the kings would have been received during S1, but that looked to be the same exact set (or close to it) where the conclave happened in Episode 7, so it's likely inside the school. 

My point with Foltest is that he still wouldn't know if the Brotherhood held a vote a came to a decision about a matter internally unless a court mage ran and told him, and that would be out of character because generally speaking mages keep their business amongst themselves. S1 made it clear that the Brotherhood's decisions, which flowed through the ranks of court mages, were secret even to the respective rulers.

>When she was summoned from Aretuza, why did Triss not portal to Kaer Morhen but walked all the way in the cold?

Show didn't say, and there's no real answer. Maybe she just wanted to walk. Alternatively there might be a degree of magic preventing people from teleporting to Kaer Morhen

>How could Geralt use Ciri as monster bait, when he was portrayed all along until 3 minutes before that point as over-protective?

In which scene? If the Chernobog, because he's hopelessly outmatched, and there's nothing protecting Ciri if he's dead. Since the monster is focused on her, it was probably the best way to get a drop on it

>How could Francesca have such a change of heart to remain peaceful instead of fighting? And how was she going to accomplish that when there is a war closing in on their doorstep and the whole continent is determined to hunt every elf down? How did Filavendrel or her brother agree with her without the slightest objection?

Francesca just had a kid. The show repeatedly mentions how the Elves are feeling hopeless, as if they have no future. Francesca herself has lost children in the past. With her new child, she feels hopeful about having a future again, and wants to avoid losing more of her people to war. The child gives them hope that they can rest, and recover their numbers in Cintra. The child gives them hope that they don't need to fight. That they can retreat from the North and rebuild. Its not entirely rational, but then Francesca is shown to not be acting entirely rationally throughout the season. And her followers follow her out of an almost religious faith in her.

>If the deathless mother could possess Ciri anywhere on the continent, why did she keep telling Yennefer to bring her to Cintra?

Because the monolith is key to Voleth Meir's plans as the reveal of a monolith in Kaer Morhen illustrates.

>Geralt says something like ""we only kill to protect lives"" yet not even two minutes later when deathless mother was spawning basilisks and blasting monoliths, killing one by one almost all his brothers that he has known for decades; how come he still doesn't put a knife on her heart or fights his father figure to stop from doing so?

Because he loves her. He's come to see her as his daughter. He's not going to sacrifice his daughter if he can save her.

>What happened exactly when Yennefer cut her wrists? Why did the DM jump into her? How did she get her chaos back? Heck, how did she even lose it in the first place???

She sacrificed herself. Why the Chaos came back is a little unclear. Perhaps her block was psychological. Or perhaps Chaos has a degree of intentionality in this universe.

Vizimir and the other Witcher's were still dealing with Eskel's death (poorly).  Ciri was innocent of Voloth Meir's crimes.

Scene with meeting Ciri one on one outside Kaer Morhen required it.

The audience got to be shown that the monster isn't overly aggressive towards Ciri. Exposition about Ciri at the cost of Geralt's character integrity.

She got focused on her child, first fullblood elf born in a long time.

Ciri is his adoptive child. He's protective of her. This one makes sense - the bait does not.

That one is mine. I'm generally critical of the show, but i'm still writing up a wall of text to sum up what i liked about season 2 and what i think went well. I'm still more on the critical side _overall_, but the appreciation post is building up to quite a mammoth in its own right.

My perspective aligns with your figures. There is a lot of toxicity and low effort love/hate thrown around, which i just report, ignore and carry on (i'll admit i sometimes comment on them, but i don't get spiraled). Many of the critics come from the position of passion about the franchise, while a good number of show enjoyers get overprotective of their own _opinion_ and get heated really quickly, replying as if they were personally offended by someone disagreeing.

Here the conflict was undeveloped and the context is just not there at all. If I was invested at all is because had already read the books and had a good grasp of the situation.

100%, especially after listening to some of Furdik's recent interviews and seeing him in the Game of Thrones documentary for the final season. He seems to be a consummate professional. I hope the folks working on *The Witcher* trust his expertise so we can get the best possible stunts.

> Do you like the ""dance-like"" fighting style Furdik promised for Geralt ?

I think that's ideal. CDPR seemed to have a similar take on what his fighting style should be and I think it really suits his nimble, superhuman skill set. Geralt isn't a tank.

The proof will be in the pudding, as they say, but I certainly like the sound of it. It should be a joy to watch him fight, and this sounds a good way to achieve that end.

Yes because they will look coooool. And from what Lauren has said, I don't think they'll be overdone.

1ojthmq,nm8od6l,"I binged all of it, just finished it a few mins ago. I don't really hate it. Geralt is way more vocal than he was in the earlier seasons or at least that's what I thought while watching it. 

I admit, the voice is distracting but you get used to it if you actually plan to try enjoying the content instead of bitching about how Cavill should have been Geralt still. He isn't, tough, deal with it. Liam wasn't bad as Geralt in my opinion and by the latter half of the season i managed to get used to him. 

Laurence Fishburne was also surprisingly great as Regis, and by surprisingly I don't mean i didn't expect his acting chops to compensate for the visual contrast to the Regis we saw in the game. I meant surprisingly as in I didn't really see him take on roles like this one. 

What I am most surprised about is that Netflix actually went through with a major plot, one could say THE most important plot of this period of the story regarding Emhyr and Ciri. 

The casting for Skellen was amazing and I will let you all enjoy it as well, one of the upsides of the show for the Liam as Geralt haters. 

Spoiler alert: They cut off Emhyr's hair. Now that pisses me off (joking lol). They also recasted Vesemir, and while i did like the actor from the last season, for the little part he had in this season the new actor worked quite well. He resembles the Vesemir from TW3 more in combat mobility. Now there's a spoiler in there that i won't reveal and that is pissing me off a lot because i have no idea what do they want to do with the magical 'family' going forward. My hope is they don't leave the situation i am referring to at that.

All in all, it wasn't a bad watch, but I didn't really give a crap about the recast in the first place because i just enjoy the content generally.

1ojthmq,nmwjusb,"Being a book-reader, and especially with Baptism of Fire being a book i enjoyed very much, I couldn't help myself but to watch this season even though I was sad about Henry Cavill and everything that went through after Season 3. I was quite skeptical, but considering Season 3 was atleast recovering the series a little bit from Season 2, I was also a bit excited.

Let's get the worst out first. As a fan of the games aswell, seeing several characters killed off in this season (again) left a poor taste in my mouth, especially with Vesemir.  
The entire plotline for Yennefer wasn't the worst, but I cannot help myself but to imagine how much better this season could've been if her plot was more aligned with the book, like with Ciri's and Geralt's plots.

Which is why this season wasn't a waste of time for me. I enjoyed almost everything about the Geralt scenes and Ciri scenes (especially Geralt's). Leo Bonhart is amazing too.

I am not the most hardcore kind of a book fan, but I will always believe that a show adapting the source material should stay true to it. Sure, there can be some liberties, and not everything has to be 100% identical, but there's usually a reason you make a show about a book series: the books are so darn good.

Respect the actors, they did great. I didn't have ANY issues with Liam as Geralt (even though I have previously been quite negative about it). Many of the scenes and coreography was great, action was great (even in the unfortunate Yennefer scenes). I can understand why any non-book readers like this series, it has the action, it has the scenes, it has generally good dialogues. On the other hand, I can also understand the fans that dislike the show.

What did you guys think? Does anyone else here also share the same kind of feeling?

While I’m a massive Henry Cavill fanboy, I went into this season with a lot of skepticism and was pleasantly surprised; Liam, who was unfortunately doomed from the start, actually did a pretty solid job as the White Wolf.

I also found the episodes I’ve watched of Season 4 to be significantly better written than those in Season 3. In Season 3, I started to feel genuinely irritated and frustrated by the constant jumping around, the all-over-the-place writing, and that “Art of Illusion” episode; which pushed it over the edge with possibly the worst writing I’ve ever seen in a series. (An hour-long dialogue shown from multiple perspectives, with no new information added each time, was just diabolical.)

I’m still on the lower-scoring end of the spectrum, though, because the source material had the potential to become a LOTR-level epic fantasy series;  but instead, the showrunners managed to trip over themselves at every turn but S04 is a pleasant surprise and feels not as forced as I thought it would.

She is not a video gamer and knew nothing about the series but is a sci-fi and fantasy fan. I’m a long time video gamer (40 yrs) and played  similar titles but not the Witcher itself. I don’t think that really matters though in the review of this season because this the most boring overwritten garbage I’ve seen besides really bad overdramatized Japanese or korean live action fantasy series. 

Her and I each watched ep1 separately and abandoned the series early in ep2 separately and both shared the same opinion of how bad and boring this season is even though we watched it separately.. 

 After desperately holding on all the way through episode one hoping episode two would get better,  I could barely get through the first 10 minutes of the second episode before I finally decided to turn it off and rant here! Lol ;) And it’s not that I don’t like good complex  dialogues or complicated premises or storylines, I do.. And, I liked the first and second seasons and both at first had complicated  time lines from different character paths. Its that I don’t like the same old emotional clichés  droned on and on and on to the point it’s ridiculous. 

We get it he loves her she loves him they’re afraid to do anything about it. We got it in the first three minutes!! We got it in the first two seasons, got it, move on! It’s not creating greater depth and complexity to keep going on and on and on about the same damn thing. It just makes it longer and more boring. Sprinkle it here and there sure. Bring it up at key moments sure. But an entire episode just going on and on and on about it. Its like the story is so thin they had nothing really to write about so they keep going on and on about the same thing. Flipping repetitive garbage… boring.

So, while watching ep 2, It dawned on me, they must be using the actual video game or book dialogue which is exactly why it’s so bad. There are no dynamics  to the dialogues or performances, its the same monotone overly forlorn or gooey monologues in the same flat tone over and over again. It’s like they’re trying to shoot ultra but it just comes out droll. Bad writing and bag directing coaching good actors to perform bad. 

 People arguing that because lines came from the actual books it makes it better,  It doesn’t matter if it came from the Books or the games either way its dreadful dialogue writing. Boring drawn out over and over. Trying to mimic the video game too much can be a disaster. This is a series.  I don’t play video games to watch  the cut scenes and want to watch all the bad dialogue from bad writers in video games. Let’s face it video game dialogue is not the best in the world. 

They should’ve gotten better tv and movie writters and focused on more action and better flow  instead of these long drawn out super boring conversations. Its a fine line if you make it too much a new series well then you piss off the fans cause it’s nothing like the books or games if you make it too much like the games or books well then its just bad writing and boring and the average people hate it.

14nnlm0,jtutqx7,"(Before I start, I haven't played the Witcher games, I haven't read the books though I intend on buying them soon. I am also on episode 6, but was accidentally spoilt on the rest of season.) 

My greatest frustration with the season is the fact that I don't understand the characters anymore, and plots were hinted and dropped. The main 3 - Geralt, Yen, Ciri - have remained similar to previous seasons. Protect the child, simple. They could emphasise this less tbh. They don't need to repeat what we know.

I'm neutral towards Jaskier. I don't care for his sexual orientation, it doesn't change the core of his character. I just wish he had a greater impact on the plot of the season.

Just, what the hell is up with Fringilla. I dont understand why she would ally with the elves.

Speaking of the elves, for someone so old, Franscesca is such a child. When you choose to fight, there will always be losses on either side. You lost your husband, it's horrible, but those are the consequences of war.

Cahir and Stregobor (is it Stregobor? Or is it Dijistra? I get them mixed up for some reason) seem to flipflop as it pleases them. I understood them rudimentally during season 2, but the final decisions of them threw me off. Stregobor more so. The man values power, why conjure flame magic??? 

As for Cahir, If there was more time devoted to Cahirs debating on his place in the Flames plans, perhaps when talking to another, there was a slight tremble, a small glimmer of hesitation. Just something to hint at an internal struggle. 

Other chars seem wasted in this season much like Jaskier. Thrown away. Rience seemed like a formidable foe, yet was disposed of with ease? And when at Geralt mercy st the beginning, he wasn't killed? If he was such a threat, i would have offed him immediately. Tissaia was so despondent at the betrayal of her lover, but before she was a castle of her own. Maybe it's a metaphor. As Aretuza falls, so does her lady. But what her lover whose name I can't spell, imo, wasn't enough to shatter her foundations.

The last season teased the Wild Hunt, something I know just enough about (ie, a small google) to be really excited and intrigued for. But there was only, what, 2 scenes with them? Not even at the beginning of the season, of the Trio trying to research the Hunt. Ik the key to getting them away is with Ciri so the focus on training her is understandable. But they seem to rely on what Ciri could do instead of using their own agency to do what they want to begin with. Everyone wants to steal the girl. No-one wants to earn her trust. You can do that for the wrong reasons.

It's just so many little things that have coalesced into sheer disappointment.

And there is an argument to be had that confusion is part of the charm, or what was intended to encourage more viewership. For me, there is a fine line between curiosity and confusion. Curiosity has me have most of the jigsaw pieces and I'm doggedly chasing after the last ones to make this mess into a picture. That I enjoy. Confusion is me trying to make sense from a box full of pieces from different puzzles, where you find out that end that there are still pieces missing.

And now im done.

14nnlm0,jq91o6n,"this season sucks. I was forcing myself to finish this first part. THE BIGGEST flop in this show and so many others these days is they ARE UNABLE to create likable characters on the screen and this is a result and a combination of a director, writers and actor input. Geralt is the only one. everyone else is just awful and they can die off imho.

the second biggest FLOP is dialogs. so, so awful. I was about to turn of the tv when Jaskier responded to Radovid saying ""im scared"" with ""Just saying that makes you braver than you know"". is this Brazilian telenovela?

Ciri is a spoiled princess, no one likes that. the fact that she can kill the monster but then have to be babysit lacks logic? Yen speech was so uncharismatic and clearly actress is simply not good at that kind of stuff. Jaskier is suddenly Bi and looks so unattractive but he suppose to be a don juan.

episode 5 was so badly put together. Editing, directing was a joke, this kind of mick when they show the same event again but show what really happened was done plenty of times and they couldnt do it well. it was like rewatching the same thing with longer scenes. you can do it way clever and it was done way way better in many movies and series.

overall i come from playing the games NOT books and what I wanted to see is Geralt of Rivia. his adventures. monster hunting. this have nothing to do with that. he is in fact a side character and I dont think he is even in top3 screentime actors. probably not even top10 if it comes to lines read. ridiculous.",0,2023-07-01 19:09:43,season sucks forcing finish first part biggest flop show many others days unable create likable characters screen result combination director writers actor input geralt one everyone else awful die imho second biggest flop dialogs awful turn tv jaskier responded radovid saying im scared saying makes braver know brazilian telenovela ciri spoiled princess one likes fact kill monster babysit lacks logic yen speech uncharismatic clearly actress simply good kind stuff jaskier suddenly bi looks unattractive suppose juan episode badly put together editing directing joke kind mick show event show really happened done plenty times couldnt well like rewatching thing longer scenes way clever done way way better many movies series overall come playing games books wanted see geralt rivia adventures monster hunting nothing fact side character dont think even top screentime actors probably even top comes lines read ridiculous,-0.0115942028985507,0.5376811594202898

14nnlm0,jqxqsfd,"Phew…. I read the books like 20 years ago and enjoyed them.
Played the game and enjoyed it.
But season 3, watching it with my wife, is a slog!

First of all, Ciri: The actress is to old. I‘m sorry even if the actress were 14 in real life, no one would ask for ID if she bought liquor. She just seems too old and mature to be acting the way she is: She just blurts out „that‘s no basilik!“ like a toddler proving his parents wrong. It‘s uncharacteristic!
So the actress just doesn’t fit the character.

Then timing: Season 2 ends, Ep1 S3 and after 10 minutes Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri are a happy family…. After what, 2 days? Everything is forgotten? 
The producers and writers are not able to portray passing of time in any way shape or form. Ciri calls for Geralt and even though they split up and are hundreds of miles apart, he is right there, in the next scene, when the wild hunt comes - AND THE EMBRACE AT THE END? Oh my god who directed and cut that scene?

Go look at it, you just know, that these people were just standing there, 6 feet apart waiting for someone to shout „action“ and not a daughter and her father surviving a horrible situation! Even the way they walk towards each other! They leisurely stroll, even my 3 year old runs to me faster than these two.

Or Geralt not killing Rience in EP1…. Why?! 

And the witches…. They gained might and power, became infertile but they use that power to become more beautiful than anyone can imagine… That‘s the whole premise of the witches in this universe: They are so powerful that they can turn themselves into women that every king desires, they don’t need magic to influence kings and ruin kingdoms. I know it‘s an old trope but it‘s one that people love! Even now we talk about the princess Helen, who was so pretty that her abduction launched a thousand ships (or something like that) and is the basis for the whole story surrounding Troy.

Well these witches are hags! Huge noses, chins, narrow eyes - there is no magic in that!! If I wanna see ordinary people I just look out the window! When I watch a FANTASY show, I wanna be transported away from this world.

If you enjoy it, continue, it’s your joy and no one should take that away… but this show will sadly be axed sooner than later and it‘s sad to see such wasted potential.

14nnlm0,jrily81,"Really did NOT enjoy it. I completely get why Cavill bowed out.

Robbie Amell’s god awful attempt of sounding anything but American (yes he’s born Canadian, but I could only hear the American from growing up in the hollywood scene) it was so SO misplaced for me with a poor fake accent, I had to skip it each time. Look at Peter Dinklage. An American in a predominantly UK/European cast setting. Yet as ludicrously posh as he made his accent; it worked! We accepted it and it was fantastic. I felt Gallatin’s character was unnecessary, and if they wanted the character a part of it- pick someone who can do that accent or similar. Not someone who sounded & reminded me of Batman when he does his harsh whisper-talking.

-Yen and Geralt basically giving eachother notes instead of talking, I thought e1 was taken from the Notebook film itself. 

- The sex scenes. I actually think the last episode had 4 sex scenes in maybe more? Sex scenes are lazy writing. I’m not asking for an opinion on that. They just are. 

-E4 being set in ballroom with no Ciri, and recurring dream sequences and older scenes. Whoever has been in charge of writing the Witcher for Netflix needs firing. It’s not a cliffhanger if I wanna chuck myself off it from boredom. 

- The beheaded queen, why was it such campy humour? Felt like I was watching a pantomime. 

- Gavin McTavish was a shining star in this for me. He did the best with what he was given. 

-The casts makeup was bizarre. Ciri having a caked layer of foundation and contour every scene is ridiculous. The makeup artist BTS is clearly a poor one. Anya’s (Yen) skin had yellow tones because whoever did her makeup did a terrible job of it. 

-Whoever did the wardrobe. Why was Yen stood in s3 e1 with that clearly H&M belt on and pencil skirt. Could they not have at least made an effort to create a garment, or use something that doesn’t say “2006”. Same with Ciri’s hair. The wig was awful and worse kept.

-jaskier being bi didn’t bother me. I don’t know if it’s true to the books; but I could see that tbf.

-At times it felt like a musical. So many scenes of singing and drinking with some of it not from bards. When the bards DID sing on the boat, I honestly felt Ciri was about to burst into song, and me, tears.

- The humour this season… where is it? The witty remarks that were clever In s1? The “jokes” this season were stale and not close to funny. It’s just insulting intelligence at this point, and you all wonder why Henry wants nothing to do with this pile of hot turds?

-Speaking of Monster hunting. Where were they? You get a brief glimpse before Ciri goes all Charlie’s Angels Editing on the boat monster. Cringey and I didn’t like it. Also Geralt would’ve and has been faster to protect her. She lay on the deck of the boat and accepted death. I mean…ok.


-The Hunt edit. The green screens when she’s being chased by the hunt and when they’re on the boat is laughable- and NOT in a good way. Also Geralt rocking up out of thin air bc plot demands it. 

-At the end of s4, part 1 we see XYZ is a villain. But who cares at this point? It was flat flat flat. And the shame of it is; GOOD writers, GOOD directors hiring other good BTS people in editing, makeup, hair, clothes, lines- god all of it- would’ve made this show fantastic and Henry would’ve never left nor needed to. For me it had the *potential* to be a GoT 2.0. The people in charge threw that away. 

Who is defending these show’s writers and their “creative choices” anymore? When the lead actor tells you it’s a shit show and leaves, course it’s gonna be just that. 

I love the Witcher games, concept and world. Which is why I critique it hard- because simply, I’m disappointed.

It also developed Ciri as a good fighter, but a little corrupted at times, which will play in the future.

14nnlm0,jujvxzf,"I could kinda get into it with the first season. Interesting build-up and monsters et cetera.

But it just isn't going anywhere. It took GoT one season to build and set the stage, and while slow but not completely uninteresting, it paid off big time because the writers knew what they wanted. I had never read the books or anything and I only occasionally watch dramas or a series in the first place, so it takes a lot to make me truly bored and disappointed. 

Here, meanwhile, the writing is terrible (and terribly predictable, especially dialogue-wise), hurting the acting all the more, but my goodness some of the acting in this series is painful to watch regardless of the material they're playing off. The CGI is also all over the place and so easy to spot (and severely lacking in other places, like that huge unicorn ballsack t-bagging Ciri for almost a full sequence.. my god I laughed so hard at that), and the story itself is made so relentlessly unengaging because of its lack of direction. This show is trying to do and be so many things at the same time that it fails in almost all of it.. No wonder the lead actor decided to throw in the towel.

With this series I at least had some knowledge to go on as I played the shit out of The Witcher III, even though I know it's not really much. But if a show like this relies so heavily on one's knowledge of the source-material in order to make heads or tails of what on Earth is going on then this is the most undeniable mark of failed writing for the screen. After having viewed all three seasons now, with some time between them grant you, I could not for the life of me, even with a gun pointed at my head, get the gist of this storyline right so it would make sense to someone else.

Finally, it's just plain boring to watch. I'm sensing a lot of die-hard fans wanting this to be good for people such as myself, but it just isn't.. and that's an objective statement one can make when comparing to a lot of other great shows out there.

14nnlm0,julizyk,"It’s so frustratingly bad being a screenwriter and seeing this get made. Season 1, with its faults, was still really good overall and what got me into the world of the Witcher. Season 2 felt like whiplash with the sudden drop from the books and random, unnecessary changes. Season 3 Part 1 was honestly bringing back some hope mostly, where the story seemed to be looped back into the books and was becoming somewhat more faithful. 

S3 Part 2 suddenly derails off a cliff. I see why they split it into two parts because they wanted to keep all of the random changes to the very end of the season. Riences death was incredibly unclimactic, I know he’s not a main villain, but he’s got some great stuff in the books further on and allows Ciri to really get back at her captors. 

The “fight” between Cahir and Ciri really pissed me off, this is the man who kidnapped her, killed her family, burned her city, traumatized her, and Geralt doesn’t say a word at all and instead LETS THEM FIGHT?? Too much to say what’s wrong with that, but also having Cahir not want to fight ruins Ciris arc. In the books she overcomes her fear of this man who’s haunted her, defeats him in combat, and then realizes he’s not some monster from a nightmare, but just another man. It’s a great moment from the books and they completely ignored it. 

I can’t even bother getting into the weird Falka stuff they did in the desert. I get needing a reference for Ciri to come up with a fake name, but it could’ve been done way better. Also why is there yet another ancestor of Ciri who looks literally nothing like her? They didn’t even give her green eyes or blonde hair. 

There’s wayyyy too many times that important moments could’ve been portrayed through action or emotion, but is instead just spoken through dialogue. We’ve been hammered over the head how bad fire magic is supposed to be, yet they have to tell us again through DIALOGUE before Ciri finally does it.

- so much talking, so little actual doing
- the things that did happen didn’t move the plot along
- when they threw in monsters it felt like it was just to appease us and not important
- so much should have been cut out. Especially travel times, scenes being shown again but with only little details changed (like with the ball), and most importantly, all the time spent with side characters we didn’t care about. 
- the introduction of so many new characters rather than spending time with the ones we already loved
- cheap deaths, unmoving
- whole episodes without seeing Geralt or Ciri (respectively)
- many moments of a character saying something dramatically that just… doesn’t matter. Just for an effect

14nnlm0,jvqx12d,"I haven’t played the games or read the books so I can’t speak on its faithfulness, but I’m big into fantasy epics/sci-fi so I was excited about this one. 

- Season 1 was jarring but awesome overall IMO. Seriously made me think this could be another GOT

- Season 2 felt off to me. It lacked cohesion, but it didn’t make sense for the narrative this time unlike season 1. It also felt unrealistic (more on this in a sec). 

- Season 3 was the worst of them imo, I was completely lost by the end of it, and again it felt unrealistic/disjointed. 

That said I came to two conclusions:
One - The best part of the show was the Witcher and all of his quests - Cavil is awesome, and a boon for all of nerdom since he seems to actually enjoy playing these characters, and wants to do the source material Justice. It felt like he fit the role in the same way RDJ fit Ironman. If the Witcher  was actually the focus of the show I think things would have gone a bit smoother/would be more enjoyable. The rest of the cast was fine, but they’re clearly meant to be supporting characters, which I mean isn’t the title of the show “the Witcher”? 

Two - there was a glaring lack of internal logical consistency, and an overall lackluster effort into world building. This is important to any fantasy/sci-fi and helps to anchor your story into reality. It was incredibly difficult to understand what scenes were taking place where, and I had no idea who belonged to what faction, and what they’re part was in all this. GOT did this incredibly well and I can guarantee you there were WAY more players on that show then in the Witcher, so there’s really no excuse imo. Use quality costumes on your extras, point out region specific features like landscapes or building architectures, wear costumes that are culturally significant to said region etc. also was it just me or were the other witchers underwhelming? Weren’t they all supposed to have white hair? 

I lied there’s a third - a lot of people say what bogged it down was a SJ agenda, which I can agree and disagree on. This is a fantasy world, and the convergence event offers a perfect explanation as to why the world would be as mixed and diverse as it is. But I’ll refer back to my second point - you need to do a better job of world building to make these things feel more natural. Again GOT and HOTD did this perfectly. LGBTQ representation is fine, the Greeks and Roman’s have been doing it for forever. So long as everything feels natural and doesn’t take away from the overall narrative then it’s fine, do whatever you feel like. 

Ultimately Just do a better job of immersing people into your world and write a good story and you’ll keep your viewers. Go out of your way to insult said viewers and.. well I’ll just say hell hath no fury like a nerds scorned.

Reminded me of GoT S3 or S4, when all the ""major"" characters had been killed, and so everything was about the ""B-Team"" wandering the world aimlessly and stumbling around. At that point, I dropped all interest in the story and only watched for the sex and monsters.

But The Witcher S3 hardly has any monsters.  ....and I really don't want to see what any of these people are doing in the middle of the night, or the woods, or whatever...

The BIG REVEAL to me in Episode 3 is that there were so many scenes of people just talking - and the camera jumped back and forth between focus on the one on the left, then the one on the right, then the one of the left, etc.   Then I noticed the weird bland lighting - and realized they were filming on the cheap by using a big digital screen like in The Mandalorian - placing the actors in front of it to film the conversations.  So...no movement, no props, no showing of legs and the studio floor.  - UGH - !!  And this went on and on in Eps 3 & 4.  People in this thread have called them the ""greenscreen"" scenes - like Ciri on the prop horse ... ugh.

The tech is not at fault here - the fault is using it too much and not having the actors move around a bit and use physical props in their dialogue - put them IN THE SCENE instead of just in front of a pretty wall.

14nnlm0,juf28y5,"Many of us who don't like the show are watching because the Witcher was arguably the best video game of all-time. The video game was especially W3 was amazing.  Everything about it was good and the TV series had potential to bring that game's brilliance to people who don't like to play games, but love great TV.  Unfortunately, I have been so disappointed in the series outside of Geralt.  All of the other characters have really been a let down because there is so ""Wokeness"" for characters we really enjoyed in the game, but did not have same sex or bisexual relationships.  Example: The blacksmith in the video game is a male character, but in this series it is a woman who looks like a man. That was not true to the character in the game.  In the game, the wife of the blacksmith is actually the better blacksmith and the game highlights her skills over the husband.  They could have just used that story line instead of doing what they did.  There are just so many instances we can point to that the series deviates too much from gamers who really enjoyed the story the game presented with such thought and care to character development.  The series had the potential, it just deviated too much. Almost every scene in the series alludes to LGBTQ+ in some manner, when it could have been done subtly. The game does not do it every single scene or event.  It is just too much...they should focus on Geralt's relationship with Ciri and kicking monster's butts.  Every episode could be based on a different monsters or treasure he hunts and blend in the over-arching story.

14nnlm0,jwd4sqw,"Funny, ridiculously funny. It’s just a TV Show. We’ve seen hundreds of those. Some nailed it, some botched it, most are irrelevant a couple of years after airing. 

Be entertained with what you get, and shrug off what you don’t.

Yeah, the books are decent, and so is their storytelling, the games are, meh, the show a typical 202X TV-Show. 

A very long time ago I have decided to treat TV as it’s very own thing. Not because I lost hope, but because the medium is incredibly specific in what it does and at which pace. 

A book is consistent in its quality or non-quality as it completely reflects the abilities and the mood of the author at the time of conception.

A movie or movie trilogy follows a given path and a vision of one point in time, usually occupying a given cast a given time for a 2-3 hour single piece of entertainment, which has to be coherent and cover the whole hero’s journey during its runtime.

TV shows are 8, 10, or even 22 hours of content per season, highly dependent on given circumstances, taking 1-3 years per season to shoot and edit, aging everyone involved by the same timespan, changing their lives.

It’s been 5 years and two and a half seasons, including a pandemic, a Cold War and a writer’s strike. 
How in the world would you get 8-22 hours of quality content under those circumstances? 

All of those examples don’t even consider growth or detriment of any person involved, scandals, life decisions or career options; leaving the ever lurking danger of cancellation completely out of the picture.

These are a plethora of reasons as to why TV shows should never be a) taken for granted and b) expected to have extraordinary quality.

It’s a numbers game, really, and few shows have ever stood the landing.

So just take it with a good measure of humour, or leave it be. It’s TV entertainment and with only a few exceptions, TV sucks.

Why do you do this? Why are you a liar?

You come across as one of the most confusing posters here on this subreddit.

Because you often have good insights into the books and you sometimes say stuff on point.

But then suddenly you start pulling BS on the books for whatever random reason.

Book Yennefer was never a bitch towards Ciri. NEVER!!!!!!

If you would like to really stretch it you could talk about their very first interaction where Yen is more forceful towards Ciri.

But please, do not forget the context of said interaction lol

Yen did not know Ciri at all then. Ciri was very much scared and feeling like she wanted to run away on the spot. And Yen could read those thoughts and was quite like ""what can I do about it?"". And Yen being Yen, she decided to be in your face and confront Ciri head on at first. Which....it did work in the end. You might think she could have been more sweet but no idea if Ciri would have believed it.

As example, Triss was also quite bossy towards Ciri at KM. And I have not seen you complaining about it ever.

The thing is....Ciri was a child. And sometimes you have to tell children what to do. Its not a democratic process with children and it should not be.

You know, on a personal level I truly believe you know the books well enough.

Only ignorant one here is you you’re ignorant to your own prejudice towards somebody you’ve never met just because they don’t like the same thing you do and you wanna pretend like you know me but you’re completely factually wrong in everything you said about me lol. Do you just make up things that you “think” you know to make you sound good and think they make you sound smarter? I think you do and that would make you the elitist L O L check, fail.

WHAOR had way better graphics even before that time. The graphics Witcher had were terrible compared to other games In fact they looked like a an older engine graphics compared to better games around that time like skyrim IMO.

What did you hear that taunt in WOW chat?

I think at least one is in this decade and another wrong assumption by you being put down.

That is why people so far, still watched. You can cheer up though, this will probably be the last hurrah as deviations from the books have literally made caville quit. So when season 4 rolls around you can enjoy your echo chamber of pandering to netflix. For the record this is the 1st complaint about the show i've ever made online.

We can agree that some changes can happen in the tv show yada yada and okay, put that in, but it is not even relevant anymore. They are chasing the big bad mage because he is after ciri and doing other shits, not because of one girl and a failed experiment. Now the definition of Jaskier is... whoremonger. Every women that is around him, must be flirted with and laid. Keyword being women... they made him bisexual which was never a case nor will it ever be. Which means they put in freaking politics where it shouldnt be... and no less with Radovad who is supposed to be Vizimir's 12 year old son, not his adult brother. The definition of Radovad?

You are undoubtedly more mature,intellectual and experienced than us.
But i have to clarify that the game you are referring to is most probably witcher 2 or 1 not 3 in my opinion because if you would have played witcher 3 rather than trailers, reviews and other stuff you would have understood better. I know Witcher 1 is not much great in these areas, 2 is great 👍, but Witcher 3 is absolute gem 💎 its execution from gameplay,mechanics,graphics and creativity is flawless ( dialogues i admit are not a strong area in gaming but they were good enough to keep to in anticipation and hype throughout story ,no matter if its side quest or main mission and sometimes i craved for dialogues and interactions specifically related to complex story build between main characters including ciri, geralt.yenn and tress and voice acting of geralt was Great 👍)
You stated things in harsh manner based only on trailer and side content without actually experiencing the execution of witcher 3 specifically .
I was quite bored by playing games at that point as started from gta 3 era around 2000s and it was most memorable ride in long time and i was not able to distance myself from the computer and game until the game was finished including 2 beautifully executed dlc for witcher 3.
I haven't been able to immersive myself like that from that poiny on i have played modern titles like god of war 2018 ( graphically acclaimed at that point).
Respectfully other person was spouting insane bullshit i understand but rather you criticized a game which is close to our hearts so i was rather sad. My Main point is based on Witcher 3 and dlc's.
I will still say play Witcher 3.

14nnlm0,jrki7i8,"HI thank you for the platitudes, but I must start off with a correction.

**I didn't ""start"" anything just stated that I didn't play the Witcher games in my OP about the Wither SEASON 3 series. It was at that point ""Runesrcape"" came in talking trash that basically I shouldn't have an opinion because I didn't play the games. Which is incredibly stupid because my comment and, in fact this entire Reddit page, is about the Netflix Witcher series 3 not the game.**  But, to provide more detail, I replied I didn't play the Witcher because I thought the graphics were ""dog shit"" at the time which they very well could have been. Mostly I was just matching the sharpness I was given by Runescrape.

At any rate, no one bothered to ask but, I have checked on all 3 games within the past year several times because I thought about buying them when season 2 released and in October through December 2022 on Steam sales. Thought maybe my Fiancé and I would play them together but If I was going to buy Witcher 3 I'd want to buy 1,2 and any expansion as well. That's just how I am and wouldn't want to buy at the end of the game series only to want to go back and buy the first 2 so I looked for a sale on all 3. In the end, I still thought the graphics engine was not for me and wasn't willing to invest in the games also because mainly they were older and 3 was still costly. Is that crime I didn't want to buy/play them? Do the gamers of the world need to flock to this page and hate? Apparently so in the beginning.

Final thoughts. That's great that you and dogshit Runescrape and anyone else thinks it is a good game, good for you, I'm not trying to convince you otherwise so why try to convince me just because I state a contrary opinion? If you feel you need to defend your position just because I stated, my opinion well then good for you but it won't change my opinion I promise you. I know, I've tried to change it myself 3 times but just won't budge!  So just, go play it and be happy and I still think the graphics were dog shit but that's my opinion. Not every experience, opinion or Idea needs to be a shared one.

Thanks for at least keeping it respectful. And to be honest I didn't read past the middle because I feel it's irrelevant to me at this point.  I'm glad you like it, but I won't give it another chance. I've tried at least 3 times in the past to consider it, it's not for me and paying for a game that old is just not what I'm going to do at this point... But we did enjoy Season 1,2 and I even liked the spin off series.

At the end of the day, adaptations are supposed to follow the source material within reason and change what is needed. For example, in the One Piece Netflix live action adaptation, the main character is given sneakers instead of the trademark sandals. Why? Because the actor is doing his own stunts and sandals aren't safe for stunt work. This is a change we can begrudgingly accept.

If the Netlfix witcher series is drastically changing the timeline to force more characters not named Geralt have screentime in a way that screws up the timeline, that's a very valid criticism we all need to hear.

14nnlm0,jucn7wo,"From what I understand, the ""changes"" aren't even artistically worthwhile. It's essentially breaking down the overall coherence of the adaptation... to force certain objectives. It's creating problems the original canon material never had... because the original author simply didn't write his characters that way. 

What many of us are saying is if you're doing to deviate from the source material, where essentially the work has already been done for the writers, there has to be significantly good reasons to do so. Like maybe after a long review of this work, it turns out these 3 scenes contradict each other in the book so the adaptation is going to change them. Or my other example of One Piece where they had to change the main character using sneakers instead of sandals. Instead the writers of season 3 are deliberately changing things to the point even Henry Cavill said he's done. I mean at least to you is Cavill's frustration not worth noting? I'm sure even Cavill's not asking for a 1 to 1 adaptation. Just the major things aren't changed unless there's justification. He's even suggested things to be done and said in a certain way straight from the books. Ciri's actress has stated Cavill has literally gotten one of the books in front of him and shown parts of chapters to cite his sources. But the writers ""protested"" that. 

I agree a bad adaptation isn't always a bad show. Sometimes the source material is bad and it can't be followed. But from I've heard, the Witcher books are like the Harry Potter equivalent of Polish literature. And the Witcher Books are praised tremendously. It just makes so many of ask ""why are they adapting the Witcher books, supposedly, but changing everything so drastically?"" I heard the Witcher video games had deviations of their own but fans approved of them. Cavill himself has approved of at least Witcher 3. Not sure about Witcher 1 and 2 but definitely 3.

I don't fully agree with hating it 24/7 but I agree with making their criticisms known. It seems so much time was spent on fighting about how the show should be written that it gave less time and money on actual filming and potential post processing. And for what? So the writers could essentially bastardize Ciri's story? If the writers truly didn't have the time to read the source material, they literally had Cavill on set to give context on the books. He was a self-appointed and highly trusted Witcher expert. His input would have pleased actual fans of the books and people like me who just wanted to see the Witcher series through Netflix.",1,2023-08-01 22:03:38,understand changes arent even artistically worthwhile essentially breaking overall coherence adaptation force certain objectives creating problems original canon material never original author simply didnt write characters way many us saying youre deviate source material essentially work already done writers significantly good reasons like maybe long review work turns scenes contradict book adaptation going change example one piece change main character using sneakers instead sandals instead writers season deliberately changing things point even henry cavill said hes done mean least cavills frustration worth noting im sure even cavills asking adaptation major things arent changed unless theres justification hes even suggested things done said certain way straight books ciris actress stated cavill literally gotten one books front shown parts chapters cite sources writers protested agree bad adaptation isnt always bad show sometimes source material bad cant followed ive heard witcher books like harry potter equivalent polish literature witcher books praised tremendously makes many ask adapting witcher books supposedly changing everything drastically heard witcher video games deviations fans approved cavill approved least witcher sure witcher definitely dont fully agree hating agree making criticisms known seems much time spent fighting show written gave less time money actual filming potential post processing writers could essentially bastardize ciris story writers truly didnt time read source material literally cavill set give context books selfappointed highly trusted witcher expert input would pleased actual fans books people like wanted see witcher series netflix,0.04915873015873018,0.4911041666666667

He only knew Video game Geralt, who is also kinda different than book Geralt. And he himself made changes to Geralt who, tbh, aren’t necessarily an accurate reflection to the book character either (even tho ik a lot of the books are us knowing what he thinks and not actual dialogues). And other actors know the books as well (I know anya does pretty well as well).

You replied to me talking about stuff, I used “you” pretty loosely and was mainly in reference to OP (hence the quotations), but considering how you’ve been talking it’s not far off from you as well. I also clearly end it with “the people” so if you had read that properly maybe you wouldn’t have felt the need to jump to your own defense so quickly? Lmfao.

You’re taking a vocal few on the internet and applying it to the entire community. I myself am LGBT and have many friends also in the community, and outside of the internet nobody cares. The fact that you’re taking the basement dwellers seriously is apart of the larger problem. Nobody is forcing their sexuality on to anybody else, it’s just that before the past few decades talking about any other sexuality than straight was incredibly taboo. 

I’m not saying anything other than what I’ve explicitly written here, but it’s clear to me that you get a chubby from arguing with people and presuming nonexistent arguments and taking everything very personally. I have very little interest in continuing this conversation with you since it’s like talking to a wall, and you’ve lost the plot at this point. No clue what you’re talking about, but have a good one.

I love and know who I am, and you don't' have to think like me but your facts are incorrect about bisexuality or sexual diverse lifestyles not having political agendas in today's culture. A lot of different groups have political agendas, its natural in a nation built on politics lol. It is not like politics is a poison fruit, just know how to digest it.

My second point in my second post was this. Originally, I was replying to your comment ""How is being bisexual delving into politics?"" and to you directly about that comment and it seemed like your reply didn't rebut what I said in my comment but instead deflected to other comments from other people or OP.  You went off about woke stuff and religion, not the bisexuality being political that's why I said, ""stay focused"". You didn't deny or defend your original statement about bisexuality and politics instead off shot into something else, guess you didn't have a good response on same bisexual/political statement. And now you're just getting defensive. Those who can't logically defend their statements in a debate with facts change the subject or cuss. Facts: diverse lifestyles are highly politicized in today's social climate, and MOST CHOOSE TO BE for support and influence within social and political spheres, that's just a pure fact I now see you're painfully ignorant to and refuting poorly.

In fact, now it just seems like you're dropping into baseless boyhood slander to defend your position you couldn't defend in the first place and just had to change topic to wokeism, religion etc etc.. pointing your finger at other's is what you do best I imagine.  You know sexual diversity is highly politicized, but yet nowhere did you want to admit it. You didn't have a good answer, so you just switched gears to someone else's comments. How about you stand up to YOUR COMMENTS! and stop the slandering. You have a lot of growing up to do.

Ps. both my cousin and my Fiancé's brother were gay and both died of AIDS, you're not speaking to a ""basement dweller"" but that's just the kind of assumptive, baseless, shit talking slander people get when trying to reasonably talk to ""people"" like you that get easily offended when their viewpoint or own BS is questioned or proven illogical but they are so convinced they're right but so afraid to hear the facts that refute it and just slip into defensive slander. Childish. **I TRULY had a better expectation of you. You seemed somewhat intelligent just limited in a more detailed understanding and facts and, I thought you would actually provide a respectful, factual and logically open-minded decent debate.

I felt he would come off as too young and a pretty boy. Far from the Witcher I know. But I was very surprised and happy to see him play Geralt. He got the character well and it's obvious he put the time and effort into it and cared about the character and art that is the witcher.

My fear now is I just don't see Liam Helmsworth as a viable replacement. I think they are close to the same age in real life but Liam feels younger and even more of a pretty boy. I think they chose him because they wanted someone well known. Also, now that Henry Cavill is not there they will do whatever they want with the story, losing it if not completely then it turns into a sliced up piece of poo. I will not watch it if it goes completely off the rails and hate it when Hollywood does this. They are doing it with the Mayfair Witches right now on AMC. If it really does go that way I see maybe 1 season with Liam as the Witcher before it's just gone. 

My two cents though. 😉",2,2023-07-15 02:19:43,feelings first learned henry cavill would playing geralt immediately doubts person played games read books felt would come young pretty boy far witcher know surprised happy see play geralt got character well obvious put time effort cared character art witcher fear dont see liam helmsworth viable replacement think close age real life liam feels younger even pretty boy think chose wanted someone well known also henry cavill whatever want story losing completely turns sliced piece poo watch goes completely rails hate hollywood mayfair witches right amc really go way see maybe season liam witcher gone two cents though,0.136218487394958,0.5643557422969189

They have so much dialogue and material to make a great show and they chose to just not use any of it. If the writers ACTUALLY centered the show around Geralt viewers/fans would actually be able to follow storyline that connects and doesn't leave plot holes. This show is just all over the place and its really frustrating when you read interviews from Hissrich and she doesn't think there is anything wrong with the show.

The book really takes its time with the story and it's really easy to tell that this would be extremely difficult to work in your traditional TV show. I was always worried about how this would translate into season two and boy was I in for a surprise. I was even expecting the showrunners to take a similar approach as season one by combining two of the books to make it more condensed and palatable for mainstream audiences. This would especially make more sense considering the usual four to five season longevity of most Netflix series.

It is hard to see Netflix ever going for a multi film series considering streaming is a big television distributor and most original films only get sequels after performing well upon their release like Extraction. In addition to this there is the appeal of this format considering the conclusion of the massively popular Game of Thrones series. 

But by using the film format this fixes a lot of problems the show faced: introducing characters early, more and longer subplots to fill seasons, creating original characters and storylines, less focused storytelling. I could easily see each of the books being translated effectively into 90 minute to 2 hour films with more compelling and focused plots and less emphasis on side characters until they are important to the story. Admittedly, the short story collections wouldn't really work in film format but the film adaptations could easily insert the necessary ones as flashbacks and context for the plot. But alas, here we are with muddled seasons containing useless and uninteresting filler because Netflix is trying to capitalize on the source material and the trends of the industry.",1,2023-07-05 12:31:09,something ive always firmly believed since reading blood elves lot really happens book especially anything action packed traditional blockbuster book really takes time story really easy tell would extremely difficult work traditional tv show always worried would translate season two boy surprise even expecting showrunners take similar approach season one combining two books make condensed palatable mainstream audiences would especially make sense considering usual four five season longevity netflix series hard see netflix ever going multi film series considering streaming big television distributor original films get sequels performing well upon release like extraction addition appeal format considering conclusion massively popular game thrones series using film format fixes lot problems show faced introducing characters early longer subplots fill seasons creating original characters storylines less focused storytelling could easily see books translated effectively minute hour films compelling focused plots less emphasis side characters important story admittedly short story collections wouldnt really work film format film adaptations could easily insert necessary ones flashbacks context plot alas muddled seasons containing useless uninteresting filler netflix trying capitalize source material trends industry,0.12828947368421054,0.5664473684210527

I understand what you're saying. But why does rape have to be a part of ciri's push to the dark side in the live action? Is that the only form of trauma that could lead Ciri down a truly darker path? I'm so fucking bored just hearing that *rape* is the plotline that is lazily used to create Dark Ciri. 

>I don't know too many stories where the rapist is a woman.

The entire history of Lesbian representation in cinema was built off of the predatory lesbian or dead lesbian trope.  If lesbians are not shown to explicitly rape in cinema, it is because of the stereotypical beliefs about women's *weak* physical sexuality, as well as traditionally misinformed beliefs (not to mention the preferred kinks/fantasies) surrounding the act of rape itself.

Those specific tropes are not specifically attached to sexist stereotypes that end up defining ""women"" characters, nor do they further strengthen some weird ass trend where the media purposely targets (and fetishizes) rape against women, or uses rape as the ultimate lazy plotline to *advance* the story arcs of women characters. Hmm strangely, rape is not often used as a plotline to spur male protagonists into a period of growth or darkness in popular fantasy media, even gritty ones. I mean, unless it's his mother or sisters who get raped. I wonder why that is?

I do care about the story.

Rape will happen. I think the fact that it happens by a woman to Ciri makes it all the more poignant, especially considering that woman literally stopped a man (Kayleigh) from raping her before she raped her herself.

It was, by far, one of the most disturbing, painful, and cruel rapes I've ever seen. And it dramatically impacted the character and his relationships afterward.

Buddy, you brought up Outlander as a rebuttal to my statement that rape is not often used as a plot device to advance male protagonists. One single show as an example against hundreds of shows where women characters are raped as a plot device that surves as a catalyst for a character's development (and the ones with no plot relevance at all are just straight up rape fantasy porn). 

> I am just not over here freaking out because rape happens in cinema.

Good for you. I bet you're not freaking out about many problematic stereotypes/tropes that don't personally affect you, which is fine. But that doesn't automatically invalidate my concerns about the sexist rape tropes pervasive in popular media. 

>I think the fact that it happens by a woman to Ciri makes it all the more poignant, especially considering that woman literally stopped a man (Kayleigh) from raping her before she raped her herself.

The only people who would think that is poignant are the people who know nothing of rape. It's a shame that the writer was hellbent on using rape as a cheap plot device for a woman character. It's just so fucking lazy. 

>It was, by far, one of the most disturbing, painful, and cruel rapes I've ever seen

There's not a rape that isn't these things.

>Because, the focus was on the RAPE and what that horrible act of aggression did to the character, not the fact that it was a man or woman being raped, which seems to be what concerns you.

No, you're being selective in your comprehension. My issue is with the high rate and prevalence within popular media to use rape as a cheap plot device to advance women characters' storylines, or sometimes to advance the show's general plots with no further regard for the assaulted character themselves. Because of how often this is done, ""rape as a plot device for women characters"" is now a trope, and more importantly, a sexist trope. 

>And yes, the show even showed dick.

Just to reply to your edit, I agree with this. And there's another attempted rape in the books (Bonhart and Yennefer), that would easily fall under pointless. It doesn't change her character in the least. The only reason I truly disagree with changing this particular scene is because of how it affects Ciri and her view of ""healthy relationships"" later on, and how that influences her character and actions. It's not good, as you can imagine. Similarly, I wouldn't change Jamie getting raped in Outlander, but easily get rid of a stupid rape moment for Claire in the beginning of the series.

The reveal that Ciri is Emy's daughter would also change the whole war with the North from the beginning: The northern kingdoms would make their priority task to capture her and try to use her against their enemy, or as a bargain, or even marrying her to some Northern king.!<

>!2 Ciri has learned to portal between worlds too soon. This will prove to be an easy escape from all the future problems she will face: thanned, bonhart, and so on. They will have to create some kind of gimmick for her to not be able to use this every time she pleases, thus, as I said, occupying a slice of screentime to solve a problem they created themselves.!<

>!3 Francesca Findabair's whole plot is really different from the books. Although I'm not really sure how this will impact the next seasons, the whole elf campaign and their relation to Nilfgard (including her committing infanticide...) will surely be a lot different.!<

>!4 Yennefer is a fugitive in the series, saving Cahir from execution. This will have serious implications on the Aretuza event.!<

There are other events that will change the plot from now on and happened in both S1 and S2.

rxj4zy,hrl8zlj,"Where did it get 14 more points than Cowboy Bebop? Metacritic? Rotten Tomatoes? Your Imagination?  Also, there were calls for review bombing in two subs, as well as elsewhere, which began with Metacritic, and then moved to RT.

You want to look at the source that has the most opinions, as it gives a better mean:

**Metacritic:**

16 Critic scores:  69% 

634 Audience scores: (4.0/10)

**Rotten tomatoes**

51 Critic scores: 91%

4185 audience scores: 61% (initially ~84% until review bombing happened).

**IMDB**

Audience reviews: individual episodes rate between 7.8-8.7, and have minimum 6,000 individual votes.

So based on the larger sample numbers alone, IMDB is the most reliable for the audience, and RT for critics. 

I’m sure you’ll come up with some bullshit reason why you don’t think they are reliable because it doesn’t fit your narrative though.

Also, lay off the ‘fanboy’ shit. Why don’t you *dare* discuss the positives?

rxj4zy,hrq263y,"I think there's a misunderstanding. Of course the changes will impact the following seasons--my point is that it seems for the most part that their choices were made in the interest of speeding things up (which is pretty normal). Point #1 is good, I was confused by that myself...>!however, this could be a sign that they intend to nix the whole fake Ciri/incest plot. Also if I remember correctly isn't Vizimir plotting to marry Ciri in the series? And if the Lodge makes an appearance they're gonna be gunning for her to marry the prince of Kovir/Poviss. As for the war being handled differently...I don't know. I honestly think most of the monarchs would have arrived at the same conclusion as they did in the show and the books--Ciri needs to die since he could use her as a pawn to gain a legal right to the lands she's heir to.!<

For point 2--you're totally right, but I think this was done in part because she's too much of a well known character through media besides the books.>! Hell, I've been confused a lot because of how underpowered she is thus far (almost through Tower of the Swallow) magic wise because of how everybody acts like she's a big deal but everything she's done this far (besides the unicorn incident) were because of luck/Destiny and her training at Kaer Morhen. But speaking of the unicorn incident, they could use that or something similar happen to take the ability away until it's necessary I suppose.!<

3--honestly I'm not sure what they are doing there. Perhaps they want the elves to appear less as an utter and completely lost cause or else maybe they want them to appear even more as unwitting pawns in Emhyr's game, but whatever the case as long as they don't start doing lots of handwaving to make the outcome fit I won't be too miffed about it.

4-- to be frank, I honestly hope that the business with Aretuza/Thanedd is cut out or at the very least whittled down sharply. >! The whole idea of Yennefer deciding on her own to shove Ciri into Aretuza just rubbed me the wrong way, and considering how she's already on Geralt's bad side in the show cause of the betrayal business it's not going to make a lot of sense for that choice to be the same. !<

>! I believe what they are trying to do is get Cahir in the protagonist party sooner than it happens in the books, so I'm not surprised they did that. It gives him a connection to Geralt, and if Thanedd for example doesn't involve him, he'll just have one mark against him instead of two in Geralt's eyes. But I could be completely wrong and they could do it the same way, as they've set it up for him to be sent on his redemption mission perfectly. !<

Honestly, I like the flexibility the show has, because if things were all laid out the same the books would completely spoil the show (>!kinda hoping Reice and Lydia ain't working for Vilgefortz in the show cause I liked that little mystery, dangit!<).

Considering the books are short-stories and a narrative tale, having the show presented in an anthological format by focusing only Witcher's Path (his contract) and showing Geralt's story as chapters through the minimal narration and flashback (narrating only his personal story for key character moments, emotion and even showing world-building) would have done the deal for structural definition for TV media.

The showrunner clearly tried to mash the short stories and the narrative aspect of the Witcher world poorly. This overcomplicated mess of a show with unnecessary additions like arbitary rules about magic, character backstories, race-bending doesn't make it sense really put a damper in what it could have been.

I definitely agree that the two properties have very different conceptualizations of the story in the books. But I'd like to think that doesn't represent a major hurdle. They can continue to use each other to enhance the sales for their property, without integrating them. And allow for constant streams of small ideas as a way to provide fan service.

j36y7f,g7a61wy,"As I understand it, Daredevil and Punisher had to be wound down simply because Disney was pulling the plug and launching their own streaming service. Its why they were all cancelled one after another. I do think the MCU shows are an exception to Netflix's broad position on their viability, since they were a shared IP, which the Witcher and many other Netflix originals are not. Once Disney decided they wanted their own Netflix, the Netflix MCU was doomed. Plus from what I've read the non-movie arms which predate Disney+ (such as Agents of Shield) were not popular with the executives at Disney post Age of Ultron and the shakeup which followed.

In terms of the show, I have a lot of faith in it. In particular, I think the Witcher is Netflix's attempt to launch its own multi-prong high fantasy universe. Same principle as Game of Thrones for HBO before the final season sucked all the energy from it. Same body of attempts also as the Lord of the Rings franchise being launched by Amazon. They're all influenced by precursors like Disney and Harry Potter I believe and what they're looking for is a franchise comparable to those. 

The outcome I'm really hoping for is what Disney kinda did with Star Wars. Netflix should be interested in developing merchandise beyond the show I figure. What Netflix doesn't have is its own studio developing video games.

j36y7f,g7a8uol,"My own personal theory is for a Witcher 4 set maybe a decade or more after Witcher 3. I'd like for Ciri to be the protagonist. My belief is that all the endings of Witcher 3 could be combined for the starting conditions of a new game.

This for instance, assuming a story involving Empress Ciri: the empress ending could be set as is. In the witcher ending she became an Empress after several months as a Witcher and being convinced by some other event.

The way I see it, you could also use the different starting conditions to adjust her skills. A new game would likely be somewhat of a soft reboot so would probably have different game mechanics (like God of War did)

In Ciri's case this could mean her own interlinked skill trees of Magic, Sword skills and Elder blood powers. I'd love to see some sort of strategic tree system. Basically you get a limited set of advancement points so you can't develop every skill to the fullest. You'd have to compromise on some to develop the others.

The story starting conditions could then link up to her skills. An Empress Ciri could have better magic stats on the presumption that she's been training with the lodge. A Witcher Ciri could have better bladeplay stats.

The reason I like Ciri is because her character in the games is severely underexplored. Her and Yen both, but especially her IMO. A game focused on her could introduce familiar baddies like Gaunter O'Dimm but also enemies unique to her. >!Like someone out of Arthurian lore, given the way her book story ended. They could even lean into her dimension hopping but and develop areas of the game which are different worlds, like Camelot.!< All of that should make for a really interesting game IMO since it would be a Witcher game but also be taking the franchise in very new directions. But a story picking up after game 3 could leave in fan favorite characters like Keira, Lambert and Eskel, Philippa, etc. You could even reintroduce Geralt with a small cameo but ultimately still leave his story wrapped up in Corvo Bianco.

A quick way to kill off a bunch of semi-mains so that they can wrap things up quickly and move on. In hinsight, that's where the bad writing truly started. Why?

But I also won't pretend she doesn't look good in it. However I will always consider her wearing only black and white in the books, never another colour, to be such a great low key goth power move. 

... 

... 

Ah well, it's a very small nitpick. 

And likely an extension of my personal problems with the 'Hollywood says you can only be one thing' situation that I've mentioned on other subs about characters losing an alternative identity because of what race the actors are. (And sure, Yennefer isn't necessarily goth, though I am, and I would enjoy seeing that leaned into.) But returning to my point, 
goth POC exist, it's lame to remove that solely because they've hired a black or non white actor (I'm looking at you Locke and Key). And it happens more regularly than I enjoy. 

Death in Sandman has very distinctive eyeliner and hair to offset a more minimal clothing style, and from the looks of the new posters that's not featuring. It's a shame because I have seen Black Trad Goths do wonderful makeup and experiment with their hair texture far more than that one picture has, but I'd love to be proven wrong about it being another example of de-gothing characters either completely or as much as possible because the actor isn't white. I'm sure she'll do a good job either way with Neil having been consulted for a lot of the show, but it's cool to see subculture style represented well and disheartening when it's all but removed.

tw2rbt,i3dvs9x,"Because of how the show-runners have centralized the show’s plot-line around Yennefer since the start, anyone who read the books could see that they would inevitably have to figure out how to fit Yennefer into parts of the first Witcher novel where she wasn’t originally included. Good writers and dedicated literary consultation could have made this a relative non-issue.

Unfortunately, they not only blundered in their attempts to include Yennefer in the parts of S2 that came from the books, they also decided to double-down on Yennefer’s screen time by adding an entirely non-book-related storyline for her. Almost all of the  original content created by the Netflix writers was badly executed, poorly thought out, pointless, cringey, or just completely unnecessary to the point of being laughably silly. But the real problem with 95% of the creative liberties taken by Netflix (specifically in S2 but also a fair degree in S1) is that the overall series became more and more convoluted each time the show veered away from source material in favor of some hackneyed side plot with worse writing than teenage fanfictions from the early 2000s.

S1 should have been 80-90% focused on Geralt, with Yennefer and Ciri having smaller dedicated storylines (given that S1 was based on two collections of short stories that feature Geralt 99% of the time). S2 would have been heavily Geralt-Ciri focused for 80% of the season, with the final episodes reintroducing Yennefer into a key protagonist role as the events building up to Thannedd play out; additionally, writers should have focused the non-Geralt/Ciri content on a combination of background politics of war and Nilfgaard + the complex internal happenings of the Continent’s mages and all the interesting characters from the first books.

If S3 turns out to be as far from the source material as S2 was, any remaining hope I have for getting a satisfying Witcher series will disappear. If the Netflix writers can’t figure out how to adapt *Time of Contempt* in a way that doesn’t make 95% of book fans borderline suicidal, then there’s no fucking shot they’ll be able to do the rest of the Witcher novels justice. That’s how low the bar is for the writers; “all you have to do is take a popular book series, and make a show adaptation that isn’t universally hated by the original fanbase.” Pretty astonishing (and now glaringly obvious) that despite the bar being set on the ground, the writers still can’t clear it. 

At this point, I would settle for an average/mediocre S3 that stays loyal to the source material. At least that would show us that they may not catastrophically fuck up adapting books 3-6 to the screen.",24,2022-04-05 01:36:55,showrunners centralized shows plotline around yennefer since start anyone read books could see would inevitably figure fit yennefer parts first witcher novel wasnt originally included good writers dedicated literary consultation could made relative nonissue unfortunately blundered attempts include yennefer parts came books also decided doubledown yennefers screen time adding entirely nonbookrelated storyline almost original content created netflix writers badly executed poorly thought pointless cringey completely unnecessary point laughably silly real problem creative liberties taken netflix specifically also fair degree overall series became convoluted time show veered away source material favor hackneyed side plot worse writing teenage fanfictions early focused geralt yennefer ciri smaller dedicated storylines given based two collections short stories feature geralt time would heavily geraltciri focused season final episodes reintroducing yennefer key protagonist role events building thannedd play additionally writers focused nongeraltciri content combination background politics war nilfgaard complex internal happenings continents mages interesting characters first books turns far source material remaining hope getting satisfying witcher series disappear netflix writers cant figure adapt time contempt way doesnt make book fans borderline suicidal theres fucking shot theyll able rest witcher novels justice thats low bar writers take popular book series make show adaptation isnt universally hated original fanbase pretty astonishing glaringly obvious despite bar set ground writers still cant clear point would settle averagemediocre stays loyal source material least would show us may catastrophically fuck adapting books screen,0.07670068027210884,0.6025510204081632

Following the books means Ciri, and yen to a slightly lesser extent, are major characters and so…sorry you don’t get your fun monster of the week show. That’s just simply not what the books are. So your expectations were off and you didn’t like it. Fine. Many had similar reactions. 

But then you have book fans who wanted a mostly 1-1 adaptation and were upset when pacing and storytelling had to change to fit modern TV audiences. Quality of the changes aside, it’s clear that adapting particularly Blood of Elves as is would have been difficult for modern tv expectations. As OP points out.

""*What is so interesting is that season 3, to me, is the closest thing*   
*that we've done as a one-to-one adaptation of the books. Obviously, we*   
*can't do every page, but Time of Contempt gave us so many big action*   
*events, plot points, defining character moments, huge reveals of a big*   
*bad. There's so much to do that we were able to stick really, really*   
*closely with the books.*""

But honestly: Was anybody naive enough to believe her?? May I remember that she claimed the same thing before the first season:

“*It would be a straight translation of*  
 *the books… I think there's just so much material that I don't feel the*   
*need to start inventing my own to keep it going*.”

And we all know that the last thing the show is, is a ""straight translation of the books"" without anything that Hissrich had to invent on her own...

So, no, I am not surprised at all. As a matter of fact I expected exactly that. Because Cavill left the show after season 3. He would not have left if they had started to be true to the books. 

Am I disappointed? No, not any longer. Season 2 was simply a pain to watch for a witcher fan. Not because it deviated from the books. Also a newly invented story could have been good. But the problem is: It was not good. It was superficial, inconsistent and completely free of logic. Nearly every scene was either annoying or bewildering. Characters said one thing ... and then did something contrary to it. Dialogues were plain - if existing at all. But most of the time the characters did not talk at all about dramatic events that just happened.

As for the White Frost, Nimue and Avallac'h talks about it in the latter books, and it's stated that the only salvation might be to use the Elder Blood to open an Ard Gaeth to another world, clearly indicating at least the possibility of man-made conjunction. Hell Tor Zirael is explicitly portals open by the power of mortals.

Before the Conjunction the Aen Elle controlled a gate that closed after, and while not explicitly stated to be also made by them, and not just tamed, it is stated that the whole point of Elder Blood is to attempt to reopen the gate(s). Yeah, there is a second Conjunction mentioned too, so not a one time thing. I don't remember the details clearly enough and can't find quotes for that, but I remember my impression being that it was left up to interpretation, never specifically express as definitely natural, just assumed because not understood.

So, death of the author and all that, if indeed I didn't overlook a very direct statement that is backed up as more than a characters hypothesis, it might very well be that gates were made, went out of control, and created a conjunction. The conditions were seeded by sentient beings in their attempts to travel between worlds, got out of hand, and created a cataclysm.

Important: I'm not connecting the names or locations here. I know the names and locations are inspired by the places you mentioned before.

I'm talking the political & historic analogies: Multiple kingdoms living side by side until a horde of fascsists in dark uniforms tries to take over the entire continent? Sounds like Bismarck or Hitler to me. Even their crest of armor looks like a black sun (Nazi symbol). They are named the black-clads (versus the brown-clads). And they blitz-krieged Redania (a kingdom with a white eagle on red backdrop sigil, much like Poland). The only way Sapkowski could have made it more obvious would have been naming it straight up Poland. Oxenfurt is a variation of the Cambridge university sigil. Vengerberg is a play on words on the former Kingdom of Württemberg. There's refences to the real world all over the place.

And a huge amount of films and books are derived from actual historic events. George R. R. Martin is very open about how many events were inspired by history. Kings Landing is Buckingham palace during the tyranny of King George. Lot's of parallels to draw there, too. The way Geoffrey treats women or people in general, the fact he's got a name very close to George, a sociopathic megalomaniac, etc.

In my opinion, this show suffers from what I call the Game of Thrones problem. In the show Game of Thrones, there became a point where things would happen solely in an attempt to shock the audience. After the red wedding, the show constantly tried to one up itself without ever thinking of how the events relate to the overall plot. Lots of shows have since tried to imitate Game of Thrones by having these big shock value moments without anything happening making sense.

tx95vb,i3ldm1s,"Simply put, I'm glad you enjoyed the show and I'm glad there are people that can look away from it's flaws to simply enjoy the show. 

Rambling: Still, that doesn't save the show from taking creative liberties that very much detract from other portrayals that have done a more well rounded job. I'm of the people that enjoy consistency and common sense, it is hard for me to take any character, besides Geralt and Dandelion, seriously when they all betray their own previously set values and portrayals. Yennefer is a scholar from Aretuza, an advisor to a King and a well respected sorcerer for more than half a century, yet she acts like teenager that just learnt the word ""fuck"" throughout S2. Not to mention how the only thing she cared about in the first season was to be able to bear a child, and this was even reaffirmed by the hallucination she had at the witch's hut. She resolved that she didn't want power if it came at the cost of her autonomy. Yet the moment she sees that Geralt has a ward that he's overprotective of, she was dead set on sacrificing Ciri to regain her power, and at the end somehow everyone forgives this utter betrayal? Vesemir was set up to be a wise and battle hardened veteran that has trained generations of Witchers, yet he managed to seem completely incompetent in any scenario he was involved in. He couldn't see that Eskel was acting out of character, and didn't feel the need to check in on him; he couldn't have sensed a powerful magic presence when Rience somehow found a way to Kaer Morhen; he tries to inject Ciri with the Trial of Grasses, even though we're shown twice what is does in flashbacks, and on the off chance of killing her, he'd again lose the ability to make more Witchers; in the final battle he couldn't hold his own without going into mindless and impulsive out bursts. 

All of this isn't to say you can't enjoy the show, it's not to drag down your enjoyment either. All of this is to say that I think most of the criticism is valid, therefore many might dislike the show for these inconsistencies and poor writing, contrary to what a comment said here, asserting the all hate towards the show is made for clickbait.

Maybe, and this might be crazy, read the books first before claiming it's a good thing they're different? Because it really isn't.

tx95vb,i3xux5h,"Played The Witcher 3 for a million hours, one of my favorite games of all time. Then watched both seasons of the Netflix series. Then started reading the books (I'm almost done with *Sword of Destiny).*

I've enjoyed all three ""mediums"" for different reasons. The game is by far my favorite of all of them since I'm a huge fan of open-world RPGs. While I really enjoyed S1, I did feel that the writing got sloppy in S2 to the point where I was pretty meh about the entire season afterward. I liked the first half of the season more than the second half. 

The books are really engrossing. Sapkowski writes like no author I've ever read. I'm not sure if his style is similar to other fantasy writers from Poland and the surrounding regions (I'm in the U.S.), but it has a very distinct flavor that's hard to describe. The dialogue is very philosophical, and often actions are embedded into the dialogue rather than written as exposition (e.g., a character will be talking and then say, ""Wait, where is Geralt?"" implying that Geralt wandered off somewhere). 

At least in the first two books, so much of the backstory is referenced rather than shown. You get a sense that there's this rich universe that Sapkowski has developed in his mind but is only giving us glimpses of, through Geralt's eyes. In The Witcher 3 there's an encyclopedia where you can read about characters, events, etc. The books don't really give you any of that. It's mostly implied, and you have to pick it through context clues and dialogue (similar to *Dune*). If I had jumped into the books without playing the games or watching the show, I'd be totally lost. 

While I love Sapkowski's writing, I do find it long-winded sometimes. I got bored during the chapter about the Gold Dragon. So many different characters and agendas arguing about heady topics for dozens and pages. I actually prefer the way the Netflix series portrayed that story.

Just like her snatching Ciri from the Temple. That never happened. Yen and Ciri stayed at the Temple to train, before they started for Aretuza. Geralt was busy acting as bait for Rience.

He wrote her a letter with ""Dear Friend"" and it royally pissed her off. Geralt clearly knew this, because she responded in kind.

Instead of that, we got Yennefer weakened and debasing herself towards Geralt to make up for the mess the writer's created with Season 2, begging/pleading with her Dear Friend letters.

Yenn tried to kill Ciri when her back was up against a wall and she had something to gain from it (and she did gain from *trying* to kill her, as Ciri did end up possessed, which led to Yenn getting her magic back, which IIRC is implied she knew might happen). So trusting Yenn when she is in a position of power and control (has her magic), and has nothing she deeply desires to gain from killing Ciri, is foolhardy.

He's by far the most admired and least criticized aspect of the show, and even then most criticism is regarding (a) his dialogue or (b) his contact lenses making his acting seem wooden so not really something he as an actor can control.

We all know how he's the Witcher bible on-set, how many times he's mentioned he loves the books and the games and also intervened in Roach's deathscene to make it memorable and tragic, like it deserved to be.

Daredevil is the only one of Netflix's Marvel shows that later got a Disney+ soft reboot. It had a vocal fanbase that kept asking for a renewal for years. Netflix executives probably approached her in particular for The Witcher because Daredevil was a great success for the earlier years of Netflix original shows (and imo was one of Netflix's best shows overall).

https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?series=tt3322312&view=simple&count=250&sort=user_rating,desc

She was also part of the Defenders production team which was a flaming pile of garbage so it's not really confidence-inspiring.

Also where in the ""executive producer"" job title does it state that the producer/showrunner must also write the script? She's also the producer for Blood Origin but not credited as a writer for that so?

>but lead actors becoming producers doesn't necessarily have a direct correlation to the quality of a show

It does when the lead actor is, based on the evidence I've listed, the biggest fan of the source material involved in the production and has seemingly tried to be the voice of the fandom? Sapkowski himself has stated that now he can't see anyone but Cavill playing Geralt. He did also try to calm everyone down and keep Hissrich in check when she was labeling everyone as racist bigots on her Twitter post S1 release.

>has 20+ years of experience in writing and production

Yet she decided to hire Beau DeMayo which no matter which side of the recent narrative you decide to believe, is very much her fault. Either she's hired a group of writers (including Hailey Hall with almost 0 credits before the Witcher) that actively dislike the material they've been given… or she's hired a writer who has been ""emotionally and verbally abusive"" and allowed him to work on two seasons of the show + NotW (for which he had to apologize regarding nonsensical plot elements)

uxmcb3,ia1lle3,"I hope they are not going the game route and saying she could rule Nilfgaard......

That was a bit silly in the game. 

Its precisely the kind of fairy tale concept which these books were not about. In a more grounded world, some lost kid from a foreign kingdom would never be accepted has ruler of a rival kingdom. 

In order to be a proper heir, you need to be an official recognized son / daughter. Which means you need to be born from the official Princess / Queen / Empress. 

But because Ciri´s mother never ever set foot in Nilfgaard, she would not be considered legit there. Ciri would at most have a status of bastard kid in Nilfgaard. And this is if Emhyr would like to open up and tell everyone he was once a prince of some enemy kingdom....which would also not be positive for him lol Its not the best PR ever to say your king was formerly the rival´s prince. 

For Emhyr to admit he was really Ciri´s father, then he would immediately reveal the world that he possibly caused the death of his entire wife family lol Cintra would be seriously pissed at him and consider him a traitor on the spot. Nilfgaard would be unlikely to find it funny. 

There is a plausible reason why he wanted to hide his northern identity in the books. 

Another problem is.....half the book story works around part of Nilfgaard actively wanting to kill Ciri. Now, if she was some official Nilfgaard princess....this would be crazy. Its one thing to go after some foreign royal. Its another thing to go openly after your own royal family. That would pretty much be open civil war and an attempt to overthrow current ruling house. 

Now some big spoilers for the book political plot: 

>!Even Skellen with his concept of decreasing monarch powers and moving towards democracy. If Ciri would be a true Nilfgaard royal, he would be better by controlling her and at least attempt to influence her his way. He could maybe force her to sign some Magna Carta kind of document and get extra democracy right there. Then overthrow Emhyr and place Ciri in power with her being ready to give more power to the people. Considering Ciri´s book personality, its not even beyond possibility that she would go with such an idea. Its pretty much right around her morals. !<

So, for all this to function realistically, they would need to change the entire power dynamics in Nilfgaard. Create some serious civil war threat. But there would be more people in the South willing to support Ciri if she was recognized / presented as their princess. Which...again...the book dynamics assume she is a foreign princess that Nilfgaard only wants to use. That in turn goes along with being very dangerous to admit who she is. Because none is going to be even friendly with her. Even if they find out she is Cintra´s royal blood, they will still at best consider her like some high level hostage. This is worlds apart from having soldiers going around willing to flock to her and protect their princess. The later should happen if anyone considered her legit Nilfgaardian.",2,2022-05-26 16:03:47,hope going game route saying could rule nilfgaard bit silly game precisely kind fairy tale concept books grounded world lost kid foreign kingdom would never accepted ruler rival kingdom order proper heir need official recognized son daughter means need born official princess queen empress ciris mother never ever set foot nilfgaard would considered legit ciri would status bastard kid nilfgaard emhyr would like open tell everyone prince enemy kingdomwhich would also positive lol best pr ever say king formerly rivals prince emhyr admit really ciris father would immediately reveal world possibly caused death entire wife family lol cintra would seriously pissed consider traitor spot nilfgaard would unlikely find funny plausible reason wanted hide northern identity books another problem ishalf book story works around part nilfgaard actively wanting kill ciri official nilfgaard princessthis would crazy one thing go foreign royal another thing go openly royal family would pretty much open civil war attempt overthrow current ruling house big spoilers book political plot even skellen concept decreasing monarch powers moving towards democracy ciri would true nilfgaard royal would better controlling least attempt influence way could maybe force sign magna carta kind document get extra democracy right overthrow emhyr place ciri power ready give power people considering ciris book personality even beyond possibility would go idea pretty much right around morals function realistically would need change entire power dynamics nilfgaard create serious civil war threat would people south willing support ciri recognized presented princess whichagainthe book dynamics assume foreign princess nilfgaard wants use turn goes along dangerous admit none going even friendly even find cintras royal blood still best consider like high level hostage worlds apart soldiers going around willing flock protect princess later happen anyone considered legit nilfgaardian,0.13839517625231912,0.536432436611008

b) You are the local prince who went to a foreign land and invaded his own lands...killing his mother in law and placing his own daughter in danger. This one would be seen as a kind of civil war. There would be a huge uproar against him and people would try to turn Ciri against her father. Ciri herself would have severe issues with her own father.

 In a show with monsters, dimensional travel and mutant superhumans. Even the politics of the world isn't exactly all that rational, which... honestly is more realistic anyway

>You would be telling Nilfgaard that your emperor was the prince of Cintra. This to Nilfgaardians would look like they had been conquered by Cintra lol

There's been no evidence presented that the Nilfgaardians would object to this, or are otherwise conditioned to see it that way. The man was an exile at the time anyway, and a prince marrying a foreign princess is hardly conquest in any sort of medievalist setting. England wasn't conquered by Spain when Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon for instance.

>. You would be telling Cintra that your prince just invaded you and butchered his own family. 

Somehow I doubt this would be a problem for the religiously obsessed Nilfgaardians. You need to remember that Season 1 made it clear that Cintra was presented as basically a heretical nation. Its why the North didn't intervene to protect them. So for the Nilfgaardians, it seems perfectly reasonable.

>This to Cintrans would make Emhyr look like a traitor. 

And coming to the Cintrians it likely will too. S1 was at odds to show that propaganda against Calanthe was rife. Not only was the brotherhood and the other kingdoms against her, we had an entire scene of Pavetta fighting with her. While its true that Cintra's human population might well be anti-Nilfgaard, if there's enough propaganda that she was basically a heretic (which S1 argues did happen) and Emhyr and Fringilla have gone to great lengths to conciliate its non-human population which *we do know* Calanthe was oppressing, Emhyr could easily have a powerful base. One that is legitimized by the proclamation of his daughter, carrier of both Elder Blood (as a way of conciliating the Elves, who thanks to Francesca are being harbored in the region creating their Dol Blathanna, a powerful rump state for Nilfgaard) and effectively presenting Ciri as the reformed heir rejecting her heretical grandmother.

On the latter front, its basically what the incest-plot was about in the books anyway. Why would the Cintrans accept Emhyr for basically forcing a marriage to Ciri? Because its basically argued that she's the legitimate heir, and that's what matters. So Emhyr claiming her as his daughter doesn't impact this side of the plot. Is it unrealistic? Perhaps so, though I'd argue it presupposes a level of ""democratic thinking"" that isn't always necessary for medieval shows (why did the North accept the Bolton overlords in Game of Thrones for instance?). Moreover its an element that's consistent with the books.

>No way they would accept him. You would need some angle that people really hated Calanthe. Not possible to make Calanthe less legitimate because Emhyr would need Calanthe legitimate in order for Ciri to also be legitimate in Cintra.

There's enough evidence in S1 that Calanthe wasn't necessarily popular given her murderous ways. And ""popularity"" isn't relevant to monarchies in these settings. You're applying a modernist perspective... which is fine. But that doesn't mean the alternative position is illogical. You just don't like it.

>. You would be telling the main audience that Emhyr just waged war against his own family because.....apparently he could not talk with them for.....reasons.

This is fairly consistent for medieval shows... or even political shows. Honestly most television problems could be sorted if people just sat down and spoke to each other rationally. Heck most *real world* problems could be solved that way. There's no logic to Russia invading Ukraine is there? It happens. Its not illogical for characters in a TV show to act violently in a political show.

>Politically, there are 2 very different scenarios:  
>  
>a) You are a foreigner who happened to invade and kill the local royals. But you wish to respect them and get their legitimate heir in power. This would be seen as a foreign power appeasing locals.

And married the heir. And the show hasn't revealed how Pavetta's death was presented. She died in a shipwreck. If I were a showwriter I would push this as Emhyr blaming Skelligers and effectively presenting his conquest of Nilfgaard as proof of Calanthe's treachery. Which makes sense for him then to seek out his legitimate daughter as heir for the country. >!The show hasn't revealed yet Emhyr's culpability in Pavetta's death. !<Politically though for Emhyr to use her death as an implied false flag, and juxtapose it with his whole religious mission is consistent.

And you *are ignoring* the religious angle that the show has presented through the two Seasons as driving the Nilfgaardians. Emhyr's conquest is as much crusade as politics.

>b) You are the local prince who went to a foreign land and invaded his own lands...killing his mother in law and placing his own daughter in danger. This one would be seen as a kind of civil war. There would be a huge uproar against him and people would try to turn Ciri against her father. Ciri herself would have severe issues with her own father.

... You're assuming Emhyr is at all interested in conciliating Ciri here. You're reading too far ahead. So far all its been made clear is that he wants her. Like the others want her. None of them care what Ciri actually wants. The essence of the story of the Witcher is that the *only people* who care what Ciri wants for herself are ultimately going to be her real family. Geralt. Yennefer. Dandelion.

Also like none of this is relevant to the original story because Emhyr wanting to bone Ciri has all those issues too, so the OG story is just as inconsistent then if you apply all these positions to it. 

>The game is just a game and does not need to be seriously concerned with story consistency.

That's a very weird characterization of a story driven gaming experience. Good narrative games take stories very seriously

> But you should not use a game level story writing on a TV series......because the series is not built in order to give you multiple endings. A TV series should be built in order to deliver a strong consistent story.

Which it so far is. Nobody has said the TV show is going for multiple endings(?). The point is that like the games, they've taken a certain narrative choice because the position in the lore is probably just too goddamn weird and creepy for an ordinary audience.

>Unfortunately, Netflix is writing their series like if it was a video game. And this is part of the reason why they are slowly but steady loosing viewers and unable to expand into the masses. Contrary to early GoT seasons, Netflix is concerned about looking cool. But the masses need a serious story and well developed characters to get immersed into.

We are talking about a show that is among their most watched. I don't know how you've gotten ""slowly but steady loosing viewers"" given that you've only got two datapoints. S1 viewership and S2 viewership. With S2 having extremely strong numbers. A dip yes... but considering that there was a longer than usual hiatus between shows, that's hardly shocking. 

>You give people just the cool factor ...

It honestly feels like you've missed all the nuance from the story in S1 and S2. Which is fine... but it doesn't make for poor political writing. And High Politics is only part of the Witcher's brief. Its also a fantasy action show... as much Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons as it is Game of Thrones. Expecting it to be some sort of high level medieval-modern politics dissertation is low key silly.

>If you want the big epic factor you need conspiracies which make sense...

So far we've seen that, given the discussions on this subreddit. In one way the show is hampered in that because the books exist, everyone knows the broad political beats. Nobody watched the Fellowship of the Ring and asked ""Wait, what is going on with Boromir all intense and shit about Gondor"" because honestly they knew where the story was going. Ditto with Faramir in the second movie. The show does have similar problems, though they've tackled it by making interesting changes that keep the broad beats of the story but nonetheless introduce enough new material that the suspense is alive.

The issue was realism, not sense. There's a big difference. I've not said the show doesn't need to make sense. The whole point of my post is to highlight how it *does* make sense. But to expect *realism* is different. For example... this is a world with magic, including teleportation. Now in a faux-medieval setting, it might be unrealistic for instant communication between say Redania and Cintra. But it is not unreasonable or nonsensical for this show because magic exists.

The more the fantastical elements you have, and the Witcher world has a *lot* of fantasy elements, the less you can hold the show to historical or contemporary issues of realism. While I agree the ideas should nonetheless make sense, if magic, or other aspects of fantasy offer explanations for outcomes then it doesn't mean the show has acted without sense.

Edit: And I should edit to add that so far as adherence to lore goes, the politics even in the books isn't always clean high politics with lots of reasoning. There are all kinds of jumps and somewhat inexplicable things that happen in the books politically and are taken as a given. For the show to then redo those might be unrealistic, but would not in violation of the lore.

So if they start shooting early 2022, a mid 2023 sounds very plausible. But there are other things to take into consideration like scheduling conflicts and all that jazz. 

Also, if they get into a good groove and organize when they want to start shooting and release each season, I do believe that they can do one season per year or at least very close to that.

Do you really think they’re gonna release a spin off in between every season? I personally find that hard to believe and honestly, I’m not sure I’m the biggest fan of that idea.

> Apparently show Yennefer does not care (about inviting Triss over her) about that but book Yen sure did.

You’re absolutely correct that book Yen was pissed and gave us the amazing Dear Friend response, but of course Geralt in the show thought Yennefer dead at this point so it wouldn’t make sense for him to ask her…

> Ciri and the bard did witness Geralt + Yennefer´s reunion. Which was really their important reunion after a couple years apart in the books. Jaskier did some narration. The dialogues were different and more serious in the books.

Some of the dialogue here is literally verbatim from ToC. No unicorn joke of course, but that’s an Easter egg to game fans more than anything because the unicorn was a throwaway comment in the books.  I actually really liked that scene. 

For the rest, yeah I agree, that’s how it happened in the books. Yet no offense, but why does it matter? You know the vast majority of these things can’t happen based on S1 and S2. 

Yennefer can’t simply go to Aretuza without supplication because she’s a traitor. Geralt isn’t going to send Ciri to her because she initially wanted to kill her in S2 and he doesn’t trust her. All the other mages have more

14p3id9,jqhfh65,"If I would have to imagine.....

Being practical,

I think Cavill was having issues with producers all the way from Season 1. But he would have been willing to go on because he loves portraying the Witcher.

However, after Season 2 performed worse vs Season 1, likely Netflix wanted to cut some budget. And that started to generate very high admin pressure to get rid of expensive stuff. Which...unfortunately Cavill was most likely quite expensive compared to all other cast.

Things just then escalate.....its corporate business. Management starts to piss you as much as they can. And eventually everyone gets mad at everyone and it will reach the point of no return.

This also explains why they replaced him by discount Hemsworth. Its pretty obvious they want to cut costs.

Now, Cavill was likely easy to piss due to him being overall disappointed with the series. So I think it did not really take that much to make him leave.

The rumours that they started to leak out that he was going around correcting everyone and was a nerd.....that kind of stuff was intended to piss him.

I can imagine also contract renewal meetings getting very shady with people all mad at each other. Producers maybe wanting to cut his pay and Henry not very happy about it. 

I know how corporate works inside and this would be my best guess.

The incredibly cold approach he has had towards the show since leaving also points towards this kind of scenario.

That thing actually changes Ciri´s character lol

You seem not to understand this but Ciri´s character at this point in the story is way more innocent. She is also younger but that´s not the real issue.

The real issue is that she would not be ready to face any grown up monster at this point in the story. From a mental perspective. She was not ready to kill people either this early in the story.

Changing this does change her overall character arc. It ruins what was her progression in the books. And it kind of turns her into a character that cant further progress anymore. Which is a narrative issue that the series is going to have and is already experiencing some complains about it.

It also changes the dynamics between her and Geralt.

In which book Geralt was way more careful / protective towards her. And this also changes Geralt´s character.

To give you an example: 

This would be akin to having the hobbits fighting the ring wraiths alone in Fellowship of the Ring and not having Aragorn save them.

14p3id9,jqijmir,"The way they traveled in Ebbing was definitely similar (moving on horseback from place to place and not staying long). It was for a shorter time though. They show implies close to a year I think, ebbing was for a few months. And honestly, I’m glad they added more time here. It was too short in the books, Sapko obviously was at the point where he just wanted to end it as all of LOTL ending was rushed, and in the show they were more damaged and needed to heal. 

S3 is more faithful to the books than the other seasons. That’s just a fact. It’s more faithful to the themes of found family and those relationships, to Yennefer’s book character and her motives, petty sorceresses hatching plots, etc.

Faithful doesn’t have to mean exact replica. LOTR movies are not an exact replica to the books and I still love them. The problem comes when base characters are changed completely. S2 was exceptionally bad with this, and while S1 was less I still had problems. S3 is more faithful than both. That doesn’t mean it’s perfect (it’s not, there are still glaring issues), it means it’s more faithful than before. 

To be quite frank, the dishonest people here are every single book fan who’s been with me saying they don’t want or expect an exact replica of the books and now demanding they do. It’s childish, petty, and embarrassing.

Also, side note,  I can’t understand why you’re wanting a love triangle between Geralt/Yennefer/Triss. First, that’s more a game thing, as you know in the books Triss never stood a chance over Yennefer. Triss was one regretted night, followed by years of obsession. It was the games that gave the rise to Team Triss, and to the idea that Geralt and Yennefer were only together because of a wish, and that was a major mistake.

You do have interviews at events and stuff where you do not control as well which journalists will speak with whom. But there tends to be some sort of control.

Sometimes when some topics get out into the public its because someone already pissed someone internally and there has been a decision to let it go public. Usually this is something like ""lets address it first in a controlled way before we get hit big time by this info out of control""

14c2tdd,joj8c10,"The writing is still terrible and it shows even in these fight scenes.

Just watch how characters think and react.

First we have to ask why does it take Ciri ages to draw her sword when she is clearly being threatened? Was she really so keen on displaying her new kung fu abilities? They look very realistic coming from a girl her size.....yup....here we go with americans being americans lol

I can imagine Ciri thinking like: 

""Ahhhh I can see this fight is not going to be decided by our skills with chaos or with our skills with a sword. This fight needs to be decided by our skills at punching each other in the face"" Of course :)

After killing a guy with deflecting fire, Yennefer just walks around doing NOTHING lol She allows Ciri to move into a 1vs1 against Rience because......reasons!!!!! Yeah...in Yen´s mind Ciri is absolutely the more qualified to face Rience 1 vs 1. SURE!!!! Lets just let her try.

And Yen keeps standing there doing NOTHING lol

She is a mage!!!!!!!!!! If Rience is busy because he is handling Ciri, Yen for sure knows a couple spells she could use in his back :p And she is conveniently not being threatened by anyone else. She is just there using the ancient secret technique of ""Standing around staring at your opponent´s back""

Great that she finally decides to move in order to freeze the portal Rience just escaped through. And very convenient that said portal distracted Rience enough so that Ciri could escape. Lucky heroes because they were looking too dumb to figure out how to attack Rience from multiple directions :p

But the dumbness continues with.........GERALT just blindly jumping into an unknown portal alone lol

Talk about being suicidal......imagine there were like 100 mages on the other side. He just does not know lol He could have been killed right then and there lol

And Geralt just jumps into the unknown when Ciri was right there and he should have been concerned with being Ciri´s bodyguard instead of jumping into ""who knows where"" and leaving Ciri behind.

And who the hell opened the portal for Rience? Where did that someone go? Did they just really need to go use the bathroom and could not wait to support Rience´s arrival?

Also, when Geralt conveniently notices his dumbness and manages to jump back (lucky him that someone decided to portal Rience back into some abandoned room), the people who were throwing arrows at the portal just are not around anymore. But its funny how Geralt just has a good instant to look around instead of returning into a fight scene. And after a couple seconds, we realize everyone is busy in a fight....so....who was free to throw some arrows just moments before?  You will notice there is not a single individual with a bow in sight lol

Very convenient that everyone in the fight scene is deciding to ignore both Ciri and Yen.

And what are Ciri and Yen doing at the end of the fight scene? Did they just run somewhere else and left Geralt fighting alone? Because they are nowhere to be seen in the last sequence.

😳

They are not book accurate. Not, if You call having a few names and places right to be enough to be book accurate. The characters still are far off in many aspects - and in those places happen different things. 

The thing with the ""dear friend""-letters is a slap in the face of every fan of the books. They totally butchered this - and they butchered it on purpose. 

Shaerrawedd is totally different in the book. In the book the elves attack for a totally different reason. Yen should not be there at all. Rience should not be there at all. Nor does the scene make much sense within the show. 

Belleteyn is totally different in the books. Ciri should not be there at all. Nor does it make sense within the story that they take her there, as they know she is hunted and should hide. 

The scene on the ferry is totally different in the books and has a totally different background and outcome.

In the book they do not attend the ball at Aretuza to find proof against Stregobor.

I respect it, just dislike it when one bisexual tries to say something is offensive to all of us. 

I think the difference with Jaskier has been the way specifically Joey has played him and how carefully he has approached it, which is very evident when he talks about it in interviews. While Jaskier has casual flings, he is also shown to have deeper relationships and suffered broken hearts when they don't work out. Saving this ""reveal"" for S3 was the best decision to me because he's already had a season out from S1 where, in his younger days, he basically was a slut, and now he's moved on, had his own very important plots, and been fully fleshed out. I just think combining all of that with him being bisexual skips over the idea of it simply following the stereotype, because Jaskier is many things, not ""just the bisexual.""

My only real issues beyond that were Geralt not taking Firebro's head on the way back out through the portal -- and not even justifying it with needing him alive for interrogation or whatever-- and some of the ""travel times"" as people bounced around place to place feeling super iffy again.

The fights were cool, the relationships were okay, but it did not really stir anything up for me. I usually love book adaptations as they make me aware of books that I might be interested in reading, and I do want to read the books, but I feel the series, it lacks any gravitas. The only time I felt slightly emotional is when Geralt heared about Visena, but that whole scene relied on Henry’s acting skills and that is it.

No it is not horrible but I absolutely understand why the fans are upset. I also felt upset about the last two seasons of GoT as they obviously have no idea how to finish the story in a way that was meaningful and gave us a good taste in our mouth.

The best parallel for me would be the Outlander series. They do a great job adapting the books and they do steer away from the original but do it in a manner that respects the original, the whole series is amazing and I can connect to it and it stays with me forever. This show is very mediocre.

14mxna8,jq6z7m7,"Yep I agree, as a longtime Witcher game and book fan the showrunners really nailed the overall feel of the season. Our main characters are not only more true to their respective roots, but also there is added complexity that I feel the books didn't explore too much, like Jaskier's sadness and yearning to help the group and Ciri's eagerness to live up to her destiny.

Other positives I appreciated is the show's interpretation of some events that happen in the books, the improved CGI and writing, the branching storylines that all are interesting, and the show's willingness to focus more on political intrigue rather than all-out fighting.

The things I didn't like was the first episode's pacing, Djikstra and Phillipa's weird BDSM relationship, the character's pronunciation of Rience (it's Rye-awnce), and the little bits of clunkiness with the how the ball went (even though I really enjoyed the episode).

Rita and Tissaia were actually more inviting to Ciri in the books once they were aware who she was.

And the reason why they were mad at her in the books was because she was using magic in town which was something they were supervising. Its like....if you park your car in a wrong place you cant complain the cops will come down on you. The problem was you parking the car wrong lol

Which is what happened with Ciri. She misbehaved, entered into a mess....felt the need to magically call for Yen´s help. And bang! She had been warned not to do anything that would make her noticeable in town. She did so! The cops came on her.

Then, yes, there was some confusion because both Tissaia and Rita thought she was a runaway student causing some mess in town. Which to them was someone in need of discipline. And for a moment Ciri also did not know how to present herself to them because she had no idea if she could trust them.

There.....this is the real book situation :)

You see...they were not just being cruel because cruelty. They had reasons.

And they were much nicer to Ciri once Yen showed up. They even invited Ciri for a hot bath at their private hotel SPA ;)

Rita also asked Yen if Ciri would like to attend Aretuza with a more advanced class instead of basics. And it was Yen that decided it would be good to have her start at the bottom. But you could see Rita was already wishing to help Ciri ;)

Also, there is nothing wrong about what you see Tissaia doing in the books. You only have a couple short scenes. You do see her covering up for Yen when questioned by Vilgefortz.

Adapting blood of elves is difficult. It's lots of world building, and things happening to characters waiting around. I think this season covered the important points and developed the characters through the original story to get the same kind of growth as in the book.

In the show they didnt give them many moments in which we could see them happy and in love....Like, they made Yennefer think that their love is fake XD They robbed us of all these tender moments between them, like for example - in the Last wish when Geralt guessed Yen's tragic past or when Yennefer heard his wish and was grateful to him and finally, that moment at the end of last wish when they make love for the first time, in the books it was beautiful and moving, while in the show (i'm sorry but i have to say it) they just fuc*ked like rabbits and some silly music played in the background XD so there was no tenderness in IT.

And when it comes to the second season, well ...They screwed up big time here as well. I personally culdnt fully enjoy their scenes because Yen had an ulterior motive and wanted to kidnap Ciri so because that their scenes together were just awkward. And later Geralt was just furious with her so its hard to look for chemistry when your women wanted to kill your kid lol.

Across the world? Will they/wont they is an incredibly popular narrative device when a story revolves around a romantic pairing.

Its not my job to worry about what other people think. I don't believe they backed themselves into a corner.

>Sacrificing someones child is not will they/ won't they.

Yennefer has a compelling case for acting the way she did. And she was also willing to sacrifice herself to try and fix that mistake. Yes Geralt distrusts her. But the way these characters have been setup, this isn't a fatal break. The way the show is setup, its clear to me that Yennefer needs to work to regain Geralt's trust. I would imagine that this is part of an arc where she also comes to terms with the knowledge that she does in fact want to be with them.

This actually parallels their arc in the books at this point of time. And if anything, it gives Yennefer a significantly meatier role in this story than she enjoyed in the books. In ToC most of her growth on the issue, as does Geralt's, happens via straight exposition. It works in books, doesn't always work on screen. And Yen's own character in terms of her desires, motivations, ambitions is far less clear in the books.

It also doesn't help that after TOC the story takes a hard right, ditches many of the original characters introduced, and sidelines others. The show's clearly gone for a more holistic approach to this so that Yen doesn't basically spend the next 3 seasons after S3 offscreen, but actually has things to do.

So far, I've enjoyed it. And as you can see from my explanation, its why I don't think they've written themselves into a corner regarding her and Geralt.

She damaged their relationship in the books - in Shard of ice.

13q2x2c,jld34v9,"I recognize that this is just a rumor at this point, but the rest of my post is going to assume that it’s true. 

What’s unfortunate is that some people will accuse those who complain about this of being homophobic. But if I had to guess, most people will not be upset by this because they made Jaskier gay — they’ll be upset because they made a useless, unnecessary change to his character, which just happened to be his sexuality. That is reflective of the broad criticism this show has received, changing elements of the story and characters for seemingly no reason other than for the sake of change, which is not what people were expecting from a tv show that was billed by the showrunner as a faith adaptation before season 1. 

And for those who still think this position is homophobic, I’m sure I speak for many with this opinion when I say that we like gay people and recognize the importance of including gay characters in media. The problem with this is that it just feels like Netflix ticking a box, making a character gay for the sake of making him gay. Not every tv show needs be perfectly diverse and include representation of people from every walk of life; what’s ultimately important is ensuring that people of all walks of life are represented across tv shows as a whole. All of this is to say that this switch feels extremely disingenuous and like something the writers have decided to just to check that box. 

Also, if they really felt the need to do this, did they really have to make him fall in love with Radovid? Like seriously? If they’re willing to take the kind of creative liberties with the source material they’ve demonstrated up to this point, why didn’t they just create an entirely new character for Jaskier to fall in love with?

Edit: I’ve been thinking more about this as I’ve responded to other comments and have more clearly identified why this is bothering me so much, so I wanted to add that here. 

To the extent that all the writers are doing is adding dialogue that indicates in passing that Jaskier is gay, bi, queer, etc, I don’t have an issue with that — they’d perhaps be taking some creative liberty with his character, but it wouldn’t actually affect the overall story. It would just add some more color to Jaskier’s character, which I’m fine with. 

However, I don’t think that’s all that this is based on the what we know. Instead, it seems like the writers intend to weave Jaskier’s relationship with someone (reportedly Radovid) substantially into the plot to go on yet another frolic and detour away from the story in the books and thus massively change the trajectory of the plot as a whole. They’ve already done this with the whole demon lady or whatever that wanted Yenn to sacrifice Ciri to her in season 2, which was largely criticized. I see the same issues popping up with changing Jaskier’s sexuality if it is true that he’s going to develop a love interest in Radovid, because that signals to me that the writers plan to make that relationship dynamic a central part of the story going forward. If this isn’t their plan, then I don’t know why else they’d do this.

In short then, I guess my main issue is that the writers seem to have added a Jaskier love interest subplot to season 3 and therefore created yet another original story that I suspect they’ll devout a lot of screen time to given how they’ve treated their other changes to the story. I don’t like this regardless of whether this is a traditional or queer love interest, because this subplot is only going to take away time from and ultimately affect how the story from the source material is depicted in the books.",66,2023-05-24 07:25:14,recognize rumor point rest post going assume true whats unfortunate people accuse complain homophobic guess people upset made jaskier gay theyll upset made useless unnecessary change character happened sexuality reflective broad criticism show received changing elements story characters seemingly reason sake change people expecting tv show billed showrunner faith adaptation season still think position homophobic im sure speak many opinion say like gay people recognize importance including gay characters media problem feels like netflix ticking box making character gay sake making gay every tv show needs perfectly diverse include representation people every walk life whats ultimately important ensuring people walks life represented across tv shows whole say switch feels extremely disingenuous like something writers decided check box also really felt need really make fall love radovid like seriously theyre willing take kind creative liberties source material theyve demonstrated point didnt create entirely new character jaskier fall love edit ive thinking ive responded comments clearly identified bothering much wanted add extent writers adding dialogue indicates passing jaskier gay bi queer etc dont issue theyd perhaps taking creative liberty character wouldnt actually affect overall story would add color jaskiers character im fine however dont think thats based know instead seems like writers intend weave jaskiers relationship someone reportedly radovid substantially plot go yet another frolic detour away story books thus massively change trajectory plot whole theyve already done whole demon lady whatever wanted yenn sacrifice ciri season largely criticized see issues popping changing jaskiers sexuality true hes going develop love interest radovid signals writers plan make relationship dynamic central part story going forward isnt plan dont know else theyd short guess main issue writers seem added jaskier love interest subplot season therefore created yet another original story suspect theyll devout lot screen time given theyve treated changes story dont like regardless whether traditional queer love interest subplot going take away time ultimately affect story source material depicted books,0.2212169526901669,0.5604376030715316

13q2x2c,jmo9qib,"1000% Jaskier is canonically into women and interest in men has been implied several times. There’s a lot of subtext, him being into a man is far from a stretch. As long as jaskier is shown as an infuriating, arrogant, but loyal and sweet man-whore it’s canon as far as I’m concerned. 

So I’m all for gay representation and Jaskier is a fun, silly little man who is extremely fruity BUT with that being said he is somehow the worst side character choice to give a serious queer romance arc to (tbh really any romance outside of the Gerald/Yen/Ciri family dynamic  doesn’t flow with the story). 

 His character was intentionally designed to be neutral. He’s the comedic relief and makes a useful plot device at times. There is very little depth because he’s there’s to reflect the other characters flaws, make outside commentary, or evoke laughter from the audience. He’s good at adding to narratives because he lives outside of them. Taking him seriously (especially putting him with Radovid) and integrating him into the plot takes all of his writing value away. If you want to throw the gays a bone, have him make out with a stable boy or a handsome knight and call it a day. 

And I’m personally just suspicious of anyone who takes an character with very little weight regarding the overall story (basically the clown of the show) and gives them a gay romantic arc right around when pride kicks up, where every business platform in America is competing for positive PR and that sweet, sweet gay consumer base (double income + no kids=expendable income).",4,2023-06-03 05:40:05,jaskier canonically women interest men implied several times theres lot subtext man far stretch long jaskier shown infuriating arrogant loyal sweet manwhore canon far im concerned im gay representation jaskier fun silly little man extremely fruity said somehow worst side character choice give serious queer romance arc tbh really romance outside geraldyenciri family dynamic doesnt flow story character intentionally designed neutral hes comedic relief makes useful plot device times little depth hes theres reflect characters flaws make outside commentary evoke laughter audience hes good adding narratives lives outside taking seriously especially putting radovid integrating plot takes writing value away want throw gays bone make stable boy handsome knight call day im personally suspicious anyone takes character little weight regarding overall story basically clown show gives gay romantic arc right around pride kicks every business platform america competing positive pr sweet sweet gay consumer base double income kidsexpendable income,0.030756405756405758,0.531022581022581

13q2x2c,jldn094,"Quite frankly, my guy, I don't think you read my post closely -- I made it abundantly clear that what bothers me about this is that they felt the need to change Jaskier's character, period, NOT that the change in question is his sexuality. If he was instead changed into a celibate priest of the Eternal Fire, I would still be just as upset for the same reason -- its an unnecessary change to his character. And yet this is all so ironic because you seem to agree with me!:

>But Jaskier being queer is not my problem with the show. I have more issue with the show making Geralt a dick to Jaskier, and making their friendship just one-sided. That Jasier just lets himself get degraded for years for nothing in return. I hate they changed the dynamic between Ciri-Geralt-Yen in S2, where Yen just seemed to fucking hate her, and spent most the season plotting to kill her. Geralt put Ciri in danger and used her to lure in a creature, which he NEVER would have done. I hate the fact the show just introduced us to Eskel and then killed him off.

I expressed this exact same sentiment when I said ""most people will not be upset by this because they made Jaskier gay — they’ll be upset because they made a useless, unnecessary change to his character, which just happened to be his sexuality.""

I also never at any point insinuated that the Witcher universe doesn't have queer characters. I've read the books and am very aware of this, and didn't complain that this change is unfaithful to the overall tone of the lore, but yet you have somehow read that into what I wrote. Please point me to where in my post I even implicitly suggest that this goes against the tone of the universe.

I also love this part of your response:

>Your rant is homophobic because you say that Jaskier's queerness feels like something that was added for marketing.  
>  
>You do understand most queer tv shows that revolve around gay people only get 1 season. That right now so many shows are being taken off air for being unprofitable, and they're mostly focused on gay people, even if the show had amazing numbers. Studios don't care.

You're playing a little fast and loose with what I actually said. I never said I thought this was being done for marketing purposes to attract more people to the show, I only said it felt like Netflix/writers were doing it to tick a box. In other words, they made this change because they generally feel that tv shows must have great diversity in much the same way that they need to have a plot structure. And that brings me to your next response:

>As for 'Not every tv show needs be perfectly diverse and include representation of people from every walk of life;'  
>  
>So then we shouldn't have any Queer characters becuase that would make the show too diverse? Do you hear yourself?

You're putting words in my mouth (again) by asking this rhetorical question -- I never said that we can't have queer characters in a tv show because that would be ""too diverse."" I said that not every single tv show needs to have characters that come from a bunch of different diverse backgrounds, which I think is a fair observation to make. As I originally said, ensuring that there is diverse representation in the aggregate among all tv shows is what we should ultimately be striving for rather than diversity in every single individual tv show.

And finally, your last comment:

>The show is not suddenly going to be about Jaskier (as much as I would fucking prefer that, vs this Game of Thrones rip-off). It's not going to be about queer rights, maybe someone will be homophobic to Jaskier, but that will be as 'woke' as it gets. Jaskier isn't going to suddenly become the embodiment of all queerness in the world. The most the show is going to do is have 4-5 scenes building up the relationship. That's it.

That all begs the question: If changing Jaskier's sexuality isn't going to substantially change the show, then why make the change in the first place? Again, this is part of my broader critique that this show has unnecessarily deviated from the source material.

But I think it is just as likely that Jaskier's sexuality was changed because the writers plan to weave some love story between him and Radovid into the plot, which means that they will again be deviating from the source material to tell stories that are not in the book. That is my main issue with all of this.

13q2x2c,jle5jv1,"The doppler stuff was in episode 6 (I'm pretty sure) w/ Ciri's (painful excuse of a) storyline -- spoilers for ep. 6 following this -- >!We have that cold open where we meet that evil doppler who says ""children are our favorite"" who is hired by Nilfgaard, then we have Mousesack being brutally murdered (I think by Fringilla iirc, w/ the doppler right next to her) and then the evil doppler assumes Mousesack's form and somehow is granted access into Brokilon (....sigh.... this is literally supposed to be next to impossible in the books.....) and then somehow he persuades the dryads to hand Ciri and that elf kid Dara over to him. He then obviously turns on them and Ciri fights back and runs away etc etc. !<

The doppler in the show being some kind of sadistic pervert with a preference for child victims was a BONKERS choice to me, first off. Dopplers are supposed to be good people in the books. So at a base level it's a complete deviation from the lore, which I think we've all unfortunately been accustomed to by now...however, the change was totally unnecessary and it didn't add jack shit to the story or worldbuilding imo.

For a show that seems to pride itself on being progressive (albeit in an often hamfisted and performative way), it went for a bit of gay panic there.

Dopplers are obviously very queer-coded (in that they shift identities situationally -- very relatable for queer people -- and really have no identifiable gender, thus exemplifying a commentary on the fluidity of gender and solidifying them as basically an agender race), and it's consistently hammered into the reader in the books that they are an inherently good-natured, harmless race who are usually victims due to being very unusual and alien to humans. I really think that Sapkowski's queer rep in the books is fantastic and that dopplers in his writing are a really glaring and nuanced allegory for many aspects of the queer experience. He, whether intentionally or not, intelligently situates and legitimizes a concept of gender fluidity in his universe's framework, and to me, that's awesome. Just another reason out of many for me to dearly appreciate the man and his work with these books. They're so progressive in such an organic way.

Getting to the gist of my problem though: In the show, it's all just super ironic to me because, in all the writing team's attempted (and honestly, incredibly performative) progressivism, they managed to transform one of the best and most positive progressive allegories in the series into something entirely negative. It's not subversion, it's just lazy writing without care put toward examining the potential for implicit bigotry, and that *really* grates at me. It's so damaging.

Now, a potential argument against me here is that queer characters can and should have the capacity to be evil, just as any human can be. We should certainly have queer villains! Gimme more!! BUT. With season 1 of The Witcher though, as far as I know, the doppler is the only outwardly queer-presenting character in the entire first season...and...*that's* how the writers chose to present my community? When the writers' only queer-coded character in the entire first season is a perverted child abuser and abductor, one should be able to see why the queer community would have a problem with that given all-too-common stereotypes of queer people as child predators. It becomes even more baffling to me considering how delicate and nuanced Sapkowski's handling of his queer characters is (spoilers for the end of Time of Contempt), >! Heck, the man even gives loads of humanity and nuance to Mistle, a queer sexual abuser.!< There's loads of brilliant queer content in the books to expand upon, yet the writers chose to go with....whatever that was.

Whether intentional or not, the queerphobia there is implicit. The fact that it was a totally unneccesary addition too makes me even more ticked off because it totally could've been avoided. It should've been scrapped, and the writers who always seem to flaunt how progressive their work is should have had the foresight to identify that as a problem. I mean, I know for a *fact* that there are queer people in that writer's room. 

Imagine being such a performative, uninformed, and flimsy ""progressive"" that you inadvertently become a bigot. Just one of the many problems I have with self-proclaimed progressives working in Hollywood these days, and I say that as a total leftist progressive bro myself. It's embarrassing being lumped in with their lot.

You seem to be operating off the assumption that what interests you also interests everyone else which is not the case.

13q2x2c,jle55sq,"Okay. In your head, what is good representation if they make Jaskier queer? What world is adding a gay character not checking a box? Because that's what tokenism is. An act of putting a minority into the mix to create some sort of publicly viewed diversity. 

Because to someone, it will always look like checking a box. Of pandering to an audience. 

If Jaskier just so happend to be queer, then he's queer for no reason that matters to the plot. Then he might as well not even be queer. Then it's telling the audience he's queer but never does queer things. It's a final lesbian kiss in the last minutes of an animated cartoon. Any references of queerness can be edited out. Like they do for Disney movies that go to China.

If he's queer, and it ties into the plot, then it's checking a box. Then it's disappointing and just another example of a token character. 

Seriously, what form of representation is 'correct'? Because to me, it's a loss either way. 

The best option here was Triss or Ciri. But they chose Jaskier, probably to tie him in better with the plot of S3. He's a fan favorite among the queer community, and he(the TAG Jaskier) trended 3rd on tumblr because he was wearing eyeliner. People fucking love him.

13q2x2c,jlhp0zn,"I think changing his sexuality is a mistake to begin with because it doesn't add anything to the story and it's made even worse because the guy he's slated to have a romance with is a cunt. That being said, with how they've portrayed Jaskier and his relationship with Yennefer and Geralt, just paying the idea lip service with one or 2 lines here and there would be the way to go in addition to some shots of Jaskier emoting in a sad manner when Geralt and Yen show affection for one another. The idea being that he like likes Geralt but knows that that isn't going to happen and that's part of why he hates Yen.

It's not a checkmark when it isn't their main focus/character trait and it's not changing a pre-established character. Sure, there will always be a member of the lowest-common-denominator club that thinks and queer relationship is tokenization but catering to them is a bad idea.

Queer representation is best done as something that doesn't matter to the story beyond the relationships they find themselves in unless the story is specifically about bigotry. So you know, kinda like a straight relationship. The idea isn't to circle and highlight queer people, it's to represent them as normal ass people because that's what they are.

13q2x2c,jldom03,"I take issue with this for two reasons. First, if this is change that doesn't actually have an significant effect on the plot, it begs the question why the writers felt the need to make the change in the first place. They've already received tons of criticism for playing fast and loose with the source material, so this would just seem like another change for the sake of change.

On the other hand, I think its more likely that they changed Jaskier's sexuality because they plan to seriously weave it into the plot and thus create stories that are nowhere found in the source material. In other words, Jaskier's queerness isn't what bothers me, what bothers me is that this change (which just so happens to be his sexuality) signals to me that the writers are again planning to go on a total frolic and detour away from the stories in the books like they did in season 2

Edit: Just to add, Lauren's tweet about Jaskier's love interest states that it will ""have ripple effects for a very long time.""

If Radovid was always going to be an antagonist, at least now he'll have more of a tie to the main cast. Maybe put Geralt and Jaskier's friendship back on course. (Or totally make it blow up again)

110qgk7,j8cw463,"To be fair, there are big issues in that story adaptation.

Lets start with.....Geralt did not know Nivellen at all in the books. Now that might seem a small detail but it really changed their entire dynamic.

That´s like you having Frodo first meeting Aragorn and they being old time friends. It would change the tone of the chapters lol

You suddenly go from true suspense / scary environment to a much more light-hearted one. Geralt´s entire conversation with Nivellen in the books was very much Tarantino like. You did not know if they were about to kill each other. The threat was very real and very immediate.

And it puzzles me that people at Netlflix are so dumb and incompetent not to realize this. Did people at Netflix had any kind of classes on literature or writing? And if they did, what kind of school is going on in the USA?

Because this is like....incredibly basic stuff. You do not change the core relationship between the 2 main characters in a story. Which, in this short story was Geralt + Nivellen

You could add Ciri in to the story ;) That much, fine! And what they did between Ciri and Nivellen + Ciri and Verena was pretty good. And, you see, it still does not change the fact that Ciri does not know what to think about them, which is the correct tone you should have for those characters. The one Geralt should have too........

And then there is the details of Nivellen and Verena relationship which get a bit lost in the series. Now, this is sad because that was a core element of the story. So, again, I have to ask where did these people learn how to write. You need to understand core elements. You can add Ciri and your good stuff but please bring the full elements between Nivellen and Verena. That´s what should give the story its fully dramatic conclusion.....which goes 100% missing in the series.

And that leaves us with the end where Netflix played the rape card instead of the original crazy toxic love story between 2 ""monsters"". Which, again....it changes the heart of the story. I know that maybe for a Netflix writer rape is huge. But for this particular story it was not the key element. And that has to do with the story environment. Geralt has seen so much war, destruction, abuse, rape. He does not excuse but he has an understanding that many humans are capable of terrible things. That was not the key message in this particular story. The key message was the complexity between Nivellen and Verena. The way in which she was abusing him and would end up turning him into something worse. But still, she was the only one who really loved him. And that´s the tragedy of him becoming human again but realizing that happened at the cost of the only being that ever really loved him. That was the tragedy that should be played at the end. Not the rape stuff!!!!!

Also because the rape stuff was discussed previously in the book story. And him being a monster was his punishment. Which the reader or the viewer might think was not harsh enough, fine! But he was punished by the very same person he raped. That was what she decided so who are we to question. And, therefore, who was Geralt to question if his punishment had been harsh enough if said punishment had been the rape victim´s choice.

You see how changing small things completely derails the story?

Sure, its still the same characters + Ciri. But the tone, the relationships.....are not there.

P.S.:By the way, if one wanted to study Nivellen from a psychology point of view, he will become relevant and he does set up other book characters.Because, when you look at him, you realize he was not a bad guy at core. What happened to him in his youth is that he is somewhat prone to addiction. And because he was in an environment where people were using alcohol and drugs a lot, that allowed him to do things he would not do sober. Obviously he also had the wrong people at his side. But its pretty obvious he was not at peace with all of it when sober.This is going to become quite relevant further down the books.>!Ciri herself will be in a similar situation (involved with a band of criminals) and she will also do some pretty heavy stuff. But one should be able to understand the difference between someone who is actually incapable of empathy and one who is dragged along by events. There is a world of difference between those 2 situations. The first one is a true dangerous psycho. The second one, is someone that you might be able to save and return to normal if you get them out of their addictions and bad environment. Huge differences! !<

P.P.S.: Regarding the series writing, there is another thing which kind of baffles me. They set up this possible conflict between Ciri and Geralt through Verena. When she sets up doubt in Ciri that Geralt might be forced to kill her because she is different. This is a big thing. Its a big set up for conflict which might be interesting. Not at all book accurate but....hell....if you want to go this way, if you do it right, ok...lets see.The problem is that the series does nothing with this set up. Or at least did nothing so far. I am still waiting for those scenes to become relevant for Ciri somewhere in the Netflix plot. Because...otherwise, why have those lines in there?

110qgk7,j8cu4mf,"I think S1 Yen you could take her few scenes with her original family.That is possibly book accurate. There will be hints in the books that she was heavily abused by her family.

And you could also keep that she tried to kill herself when arriving Aretuza. That much is also said in the books.

The problem will start after this.......

Because book Yen´s friendship with Tissaia does not match at all with their relationship in the series. Neither does her school record. Book Yen is highly respected by all her fellow magic users. They might not like her but they respect her talent. And this coming all the way since school days. Book Yen should have been a bit more like Harry Potter at school. Depressed and ""fish out of water"" at first, but quickly finding out her potential and that Aretuza is her place.

Istredd should not be anywhere near Aretuza. It was quite ridiculous that he was. Aretuza should be a girls only school and under Tissaia it should be quite strict and by the rules.

And by the way, Tissaia risking her students safety at Aretuza was a true abomination. Book Tissaia was a pacifist and idealist. She wanted peace and love. She was strict, yes! But she should be way more like McGonagal from Harry Potter. The very strict teacher who will enforce rules but will protect her students to the last. 

The small arc with Yen bored working for a petty king and the baby stuff also does not fit book Yen at all. The books give all kinds of hints that Yen had been involved into important stuff. She was a very highly praised graduate and had a very close relationship with Tissaia. There are hints she worked with Dijkstra at some time.

Last Wish is complicated. The orgy stuff at the start needs to be deleted. Her initial conversation with Geralt is not that far but there is the detail that she would not get into a bath together with him that early lol Book Yen was pissed at Geralt to start with :)

Fight with the Djinn could stay maybe......but her line ""I want everything"" really has to go. That makes no sense from Yen. Would be something Vilgefortz might say. Not Yennefer lol

Then her scenes with Tissaia and Vilgefortz need to be deleted because they really make no sense with the book story lol Book Yen was picked to defend Aretuza because she was always loyal to it and had no 2nd thoughts about it. She was deeply loyal to Tissaia and Tissaia would absolutely want Yen at her side. The series did the ultimate crime by having the concept that Tissaia did not even call Yen for the fight. That´s complete BS compared with their book relationship.

The Battle also mostly needs to go. Yen´s part in the battle does not fit the books. She was there, she was important. But the series seems to give her the role which should have been Vilgefortz. Plus, book Yen was fighting in the front lines and was a casualty because of it. So...I really do not see how one could keep her battle scenes in the series.",10,2023-02-13 17:36:07,think yen could take scenes original familythat possibly book accurate hints books heavily abused family could also keep tried kill arriving aretuza much also said books problem start book yens friendship tissaia match relationship series neither school record book yen highly respected fellow magic users might like respect talent coming way since school days book yen bit like harry potter school depressed fish water first quickly finding potential aretuza place istredd anywhere near aretuza quite ridiculous aretuza girls school tissaia quite strict rules way tissaia risking students safety aretuza true abomination book tissaia pacifist idealist wanted peace love strict yes way like mcgonagal harry potter strict teacher enforce rules protect students last small arc yen bored working petty king baby stuff also fit book yen books give kinds hints yen involved important stuff highly praised graduate close relationship tissaia hints worked dijkstra time last wish complicated orgy stuff start needs deleted initial conversation geralt far detail would get bath together early lol book yen pissed geralt start fight djinn could stay maybebut line want everything really go makes sense yen would something vilgefortz might say yennefer lol scenes tissaia vilgefortz need deleted really make sense book story lol book yen picked defend aretuza always loyal nd thoughts deeply loyal tissaia tissaia would absolutely want yen side series ultimate crime concept tissaia even call yen fight thats complete bs compared book relationship battle also mostly needs go yens part battle fit books important series seems give role vilgefortz plus book yen fighting front lines casualty soi really see one could keep battle scenes series,0.1741418439716312,0.5810354609929076

Not really it doesn't. I think Season 2 adapts masses of the books quite faithfully, both in terms of specific detail and more broadly in terms of themes, arcs and the philosophies of the Witcher books. I just don't make it a habit of wasting my time watching projects executed in visible dishonesty and malice.

>So far you referenced events that happened in season 1 and their respective short stories twice, but you're avoiding episodes 2-8 of season two like the plague...

Even when I did episode one I acknowledged that it adapted Grain of Truth but that I CHOSE to not judge it on that ground, you might not agree with that choice, but I never lied about it, and again it only applies to the very first episode, nothing else.

Yeah, you made a choice in an attempt to advance a preconceived agenda you already had, which was to assert that the show does not ""adapt"" the ""books"" (and note the plural, which you also use consistently). You made choices designed to achieve your prejudged conclusion of showing as little as possible. That's what makes it dishonest. You are very much engaged in an act of lying when you talk about how only 6% of a show and an episode are ""from the books"" even as you actively remove things *from the books* because you've arbitrarily decided that juggling the order of events, adjusting individual elements somehow means the event suddenly becomes not from the books. Or you just arbitrarily restrict yourself to BoE when convenient yet talk about books as a whole.

So no. Not going to bother watching the rest of your episodes. Don't need to give your videos the views or clicks. Your first video reveals plenty of what I need to know.

How should the audience ever believe that Ciri can trust Geralt or Yen after having been used as a bait by Geralt and been kidnapped to be sold to an evil witch by Yen? In this central point anything that tries to go back to the relationship the 3 have in the books must feel hollow.

I think this is not a good idea. Are you really willing to wait potentially years and years to read a book that you want to read? If they go full lenght with the show then you may have to wait 5+ years... There is also a chance that they cancel the show not even finishing their story.

The show and the books after s2 is so different that you can't mention them on the same page. It's two different story, different characters, different themes, different atmosphere. Only the names are the same. It's really not hard to view and judge them separately from each other. Putting the books aside for years for the show is absolutely not worth it... Read it while it's hot!

For me this is the main issue.

Witcher is really dark. It has that certain creepy feeling that almost feels like that of a horror story. It's a shitty, dark, and dirty world. The early seasons of Game of Thrones were the same, with that hidden supernatural enemy that kept getting more important. A vital part of this is that not every episode has to be full of action. The most important thing to tell such a story is all the small details **and not action**. Hell, you could have all of the battles take place off screen and it would be a great show if all the character motivations, their interactions, the intrigue, and all the small details are spot on.

Yet the guys in charge of the Witcher chose to take all of that out and instead focus on action and their own feelings.

The stoicism is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of acting and Witcher lore, most of the line delivery will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Geralts's pragmatic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Andrzej Sapkowski literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not just action and adventure - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Witcher and Cavill's portrayal truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the meaning in Geralt's catchphrase ""Medallions tingling,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to CDPR's epic Witcher games. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the showrunner's geniusly sublte writing unfolds itself on their television screens.

The problem with the show and this scene is that contrary to the books, the show didn't manage to developp and ground the relationship dynamics between major characters (Yennefer and Ciri f.e.) ans Season 2 was so full of major events and ""plot twists"" (Yennefer's arc, Khaer Morhen's finale, Fringilla's and Francesca's actions, Emhyr's revelation, etc) that Thanned event won't have the same impact it had in the books because it will just be another big event with machinations and treasons, and the relationships it affects will also be less impactfull since like I said, they weren't properly fleshed out to begin with

w82118,ihoyfij,"I think the one thing the show did better in regards to Thanedd specifically is introducing some of the Brotherhood's members early on. It's my one problem with ToC - the amount of new info and mages introduced feels overbearing since we know so few of them beforehand. That was, I presume, one of the benefits of having Yennefer as a PoV and a main character - if she was only introduced in the djinn episode and through Geralt's PoV, we'd have seen nothing of Aretuza, the Chapter, Sodden Hill, Vilgefortz and the stuff going on in S2. 

It would have all felt extremely random in S3. This way, they've actually built up some things (although sloppily, as is the case with the entire show).

That said, I think there is still time to build up Thanedd, since it happens in 3x05 and 6, meaning there are four full episodes to properly set up Emhyr, Dijkstra, Philippa, Vilgefortz, their dynamics and the trio's relationship after that VM fiasco. And if we follow all these characters across the first four episodes and see them head to Thanedd at the same time, clearly the event will feel quite large because most of the show's cast will be gathered there. Yes, we've had some odd twists before, but nothing where so many mains are gathered in one place.

I'm definitely going in very skeptical after S2 but I'm also interested in what they'll do.

So, Vilgefortz is really the only big one you need to pay attention at Thanedd. And Vilgefortz technically was also already introduced in a smaller chapter with Tissaia. 

All others are just secondary. People like Keira are just like Jarre at the temple. They are there but they are not main characters.

Or like at Kaer Morhen, you have the other Witchers but they are not main characters.

Or when Ciri meets The Rats, you suddenly get a bunch new characters but pretty much none of them is really main character. They have their individual stories and all that which you get to read immediately when you meet them. But....that´s pretty much for worldbuilding. Not that they are seriously important going forward.

Maybe you could make a point for Dijkstra? Maybe! Dijkstra is maybe the only new relevant character who you really meet at Thanedd for the first time.

1czqete,l5ib5ai,"The report seems to indicate that the show overall was the second most watched show in the back half of 2023, and Season 3 was their fifth most watched show. That's doing pretty impressively. Lupin and One Piece were ahead, but One Piece much like TW1 had the freshness appeal going for it for its inbuilt audience since its the first season. Lupin is a pretty popular global series. Dear Child, Lupin, and Erin Carter are all also much shorter shows.

So One Piece was its near analogue.

All in all that's a pretty damn good performance I'd say. Especially since I'm wondering if a small slice of the show's viewership hasn't been counted seeing as how the first part didn't drop till the end of June. So I'm not sure if the 29th and 30th's view hours are listed in this calculation.

I didn’t hate episode one of season one but with all the edits they did it fell flat and missed the point of the that short story.

Obviously, there are norms in life in general but a situation like this is never as simple as it sounds. I'm not defending the show's shitty writing but he did see Yennefer trying to sacrifice her own life (whilst knowing how ambitious and selfish she can be) to save Ciri from the mess she's got her in.

Very surprising and hard to understand how you found The Witcher season 1 remarkably accurate and season 2 to be not much changed compared to the books while calling the WoT adaptation terrible. The Witcher adaptation changed thematically just as much if not more than the WoT adaptation. S2 had so many departures from the book it supposed to translate to screen that we basically got a whole different story with completely different characters. Perrin having a wife for half an episode is nothing compared to the Voleth Meir plot that made several characters unrecognisable and regress in their character arcs, and it only made the lore a hot mess in general (It was honestly as bad as the last WoT episode... just terrible).

Even a seemingly small change like Yen not hearing/knowing Geralt's wish in s1 for example is fundamentally changes and undermines the whole purpose and the theme of their relationship. It's just as big of a departure as how in the WoT show the dragon can be either male of female. I assume you know how this is a terrible change from the books with the tainted saidin, why people fear the dragon, the white tower power dynamic, etc. etc. It's a fundemental change to the theme of RJ's story. The Witcher had dozens and dozens of these changes.

Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with people enjoying and liking the witcher but saying that it's remarkably accurate would be as true as saying that the WoT adaptation was remarkably close to the books. The show didn't just fill in some blanks, blanks that weren't even there in the first place or it didn't needed to be filled at all. It vastly departed from its source. Quite honestly all they achieved with this whole gap filling are underdeveloped main and secondary characters, unrecognisable or broken character dynamics, confusing lore, politics, and character motivations.

Once they ran out of material GoT really went downhill. Ironically the Witcher has a completed story but even if it wasn’t I don’t think it would bother Lauren and her team because they often prefer their original content over the source material. It makes sense since Lauren said she feels it’s her job to teach the new generation of writers (which is why there’s people on the team with very little experience) and I imagine as relatively new writers they want to put a bit of their spin or flavor into the story.

The new seasons could be better but it would be an uphill battle for them imo only because some of the damage s1 did has been done. So now they have to develop certain characters in ways they didn’t need to before while providing them their character arcs from the books (assuming they even do that) and for certain things like the magic system, they’ll probably have to either retcon, add loopholes, or just quietly ignore the rules since s1 established it worked like equivalent exchange and in the later books we see that they pull off some incredibly strong magic.

One can give you book knowledge like others have done.

You already got Geralt + Ciri´s book origin story. Which for some reason was deleted from the series. Still do not understand why anyone decided they should cut the single chapter in the first 2 books where Geralt and Ciri had more interaction together.

Besides that, some other of your problems are also solved in the books.

Both Vesemir and Yennefer did not place Ciri in any danger in the books. That was Netflix invention. Both of them were pretty loyal and supportive to Geralt. Even tough book Yen was actually estranged from Geralt at the time Ciri comes around, she still supported him with Ciri. And even tough she never clearly states her reasons in the books, its pretty fair to say that she both wanted to support Geralt and she had a soft spot for mentoring another youngster. It is heavily implied in the books that she might have mentored Triss in the past as they have an age difference in the books and used to be pretty close.

As you see...a lot of this was really changed in the series.

I think both Yen and Vesimir were changed just for the sake of adding extra drama into the series. And everyone is going to have their own opinion if it works or not. 

Regarding what Ciri really is....I do not know if you want spoilers. At this point in the story, not even she knows.

With spoilers:

More or less quoting her final words in the books...she will mess things up in her world, cause a lot of damage, people will die around her, people will die because of her.

15nh8gu,jvnuqtb,"I would say that Sapko had a pretty clear idea what he wanted.

And he wanted precisely to tell that the mages and even the elves were playing with something they did not fully master. Which makes sense within the story. The kind of words he used to name things was just his choice of words. He would need to use some. But what he intended is pretty clear.

Also not at all sure that there were prophecies about a ""white frost"". That´s something coming straight out of Witcher 3. The books do speak about climate changing happening in the future but none is really scared about it in the present.

In the books it is never clear if Ciri will save the world or destroy it. Which makes it that everyone decides to believe on what suits their own agenda. Emhyr believing her child will rule the world. Phillipa also believing Ciri´s child will be key to establish a new status quo in politics which will bring peace and stability. None really goes around the books believing Ciri will save the world in some magic sense. The elves just believe her son will have the necessary powers to travel between worlds, not event noticing she has them already.

The entire prophecy thing is quite clearly a red herring in the books.

Witcher 3 did decide to consider it literal and turn Ciri more into the saviour of the world. Which is fine for a computer game. But it was never going to be the kind of narrative Sapko intended with his books.

Ciri´s role was simply to show how people´s beliefs and agendas could ruin everyone´s lives. And that in the end it may well be that none of it really mattered. But many suffered and many were transformed just because some people believed something. Which I think is a clever way for Sapko to address all the political turmoil which afflicted Poland. This was not uncommon in eastern european writers. They would find ways to say that everyone was completely wrong and brainwashed into all kinds of crazy. And all hell was unleashed upon the earth just because people believed in whatever.

In fact, there is a line in Witcher 3 that makes me think the people behind the game understood the books. They just knew they were writing a game ;) Priscila says when discussing Ciri, something like.....prophecies become dangerous when people start believing in them.

And that´s if you would try and take the prophecy literal and consider it true. Which is exactly what I said the Witcher 3 did :) 

That´s the problem with the prophecy being so vague. You will notice that it also immediately says the world will be reborn with the new sun ;)

Whatever the prophecy intends to say with that.....good luck figuring it out. 

Not even sure if its talking about the incoming ""climate change"". Because if the incoming ""climate change"" is just natural like it is explained in the books....then what? the new sun will just be the next warm age? 

Or might be the frost is figuratively referencing something else. As the new sun might also be figurative for something else. 

Want to see me doing something funny with it? 

Notice Emhyr does have the nickname ""white flame"". And Nilfgaard does use the sun as one of its banners. 

So...could it be the prophecy is very figurative and just addressing Ciri as White Frost. Maybe because she is the daughter of the White Flame and the White Wolf. Maybe because she will be a cold blooded killer who will bring death (plague) into the world. 

And the new sun might be someone from Nilfgaard who is eventually going to restore peace? 

And what is the ""wolf´s blizzard""? could that be Geralt going around?

15nh8gu,jvn71gj,"Actually, in the games, Emhyr is sort of morally grey. He invades the North but all of the kings of the north are also extremely shitty and invade each other all the time. If you side with Redania over him by not assassinating Radovid, Radovid just straight up orders the execution of all mages and non-humans. This is very much in keeping with the books, where all of the rulers are pretty bad, and Geralt wants nothing to do with any of them.

In the TV show, Emhyr genuinely seems to think he is a good guy who is doing good things for the world. He helps the elves - it's them who keep backing out of their deals to help him fight. He's not enslaving non-humans. He has some kind of vision for defeating the Wild Hunt and preventing the White Frost and whatever it was, Fringilla was totally sold on it. Now, granted, he's wrong - an enlightened despot is still a despot, and he's killing enemy soldiers left and right for his own ambitions - but he's not outright evil, like Vilgefortz or Stregebor.

Why did he not just tell Calanthe he's Duny and skip the whole invasion of Cintra? I think this got lost in adaptation. In the books he wants to marry Ciri so he can't reveal his true identity because she'll be totally grossed out. Only Geralt figures it out and then he promises not to tell Ciri and traumatize her. But while the show's writers chose not to go that way (which is great - incest plotlines involving rape of the sympathetic main character, who is also a child, are bad), they haven't explained all of the consequences of the reveal that would logically play out. Or we just haven't heard the explanation yet, because Emhyr/Duny has had no knowledgable character to explain it to. Maybe Calanthe hated his guts and when he wrote her, she said no, and she kept that to herself because she kept basically everything important to herself. Maybe the letter got lost in the mail and he assumed it was a no. I really can't tell you how they plan to explain it.

As for the contradiction, I'm referring to most of you who despise the show more so than myself. It's just a form of speech. Onto the acting, as I said above, I genuinely like most of the cast. Fringilla's actress is a bit stiff and wooden for my tastes but no one else comes to mind. Of the main characters, everyone is a great actor - Yennefer, Jaskier, Tissaia, Triss, Ciri. Even side players like Lydia and Rience are very good.

So idk what half you dislike - the show has a huge cast - one half of it being bad would mean they have like 20 horrible actors on the show and that's def not the case.

And I understand the disappointment - I'm as much of a witcher fan as you - I adore the books for what they are and I was for a time angry at the show for how S2 was written - but at the end of the day, it's still a part of the Witcher world, it spiked huge interest in the franchise back when it aired in 2019. And the terrible writing is a major reason why I pretend everything that goes on is just an alternate history of the books where things went differently.

As an adaptation, it's horrible. As a fantasy show, it's rather interesting - most of my friends who never read the books actually love the show. Sometimes I wish I never read the books either because then maybe I'd love it more as well. But what I do try to do is treat it as it's own thing, separate from what it could've been and that immediately makes it more entertaining.

uaer9z,i5xrmh0,"I think Thanedd takes place around 3x05 and 3x06. 3x07 and 3x08 are imo reserved for the aftermath so that's where the Rats also come in, as well as the lodge and all that.

That would leave four episodes of the season where Yen and Ciri are together. There's a lot of potential here to use that time to mend what's broken. However, as you said, I really can't imagine any scenario where Ciri is capable of looking at Yen like a  mother after what she did, no matter how much they bond. I just can't imagine any logical way to get them there... and their track record when it comes to writing isn't the best. 

I guess my only comfort is that, considering they planned this change for some time now, they probably also thought about the consequences before they did it so maybe they mapped out a way to bring the two together again... cause they definitely knew how the fans would react. 

It really remains to be seen. Maybe Yen will spin some sad story to get Ciri to understand the TITANIC lapse in judgement she made when she planned to sacrifice her (lol sounds crazy even writing this) or they'll connect over some things.

Let's put it this way: Artaud is less than a secondary character in the books, just like Hen...but Geralt killing Stregobor/Artaud in S3 would be a fist-pump moment, nothing more than that. A pleasure, of course, but what about the alternative? The reveal about >!Vilg!<, for example at the end of an episode, with Stregobor apparently dying of natural causes.

It is, basically, a simple action moment VS a plot twist. I think it's a better way to ""spend"" a death, especially of someone who appeared, until now, as a villain.

- rewatch the first few seasons
- definitely rewatch the third, or maybe individual episodes
- watch the last part of 2x8 lol a lot is revealed at the very end XD in only a few minutes
- look at a list of characters with their images and the names of where they live for reference
- but DON’T worry about maps; people can portal sometimes but not others, and time is nebulous; people get caught up in transportation and where people are, but to me it’s like real life lol. We don’t know every cabin or forest or hideout or whatever.
- don’t worry about remembering everyone’s name or every single place
- accept that like the characters in the show you will not know everything
- note characters do NOT just do exposition and can be wrong
- you can learn a lot about a character or a situation by paying attention to even the smallest scenes, as well as dialogue
- NORTH: most kingdoms, SOUTH: Nilfgaard basically

rm1qnz,hpk0xj4,">Why do you think the earlier reveal takes away from the story? (If you in fact do. Or anyone else, I'm curious.)

Major book spoilers ahead.

In the books, Emhyr being Ciri's father (and Emhyr being Duny) is revealed very, very late. It comes as an actual shock due to his motivations for finding her. W3, the game, may have you think he cares about his daughter in his own way and wants a successor (as is portrayed in the game - he's still Emhyr, but he develops a softer spot for Ciri at the end of the books, and it carries into W3 which happens long after books).

His original motivations are different. First the reader is told Emhyr wants Ciri to >!marry her and in so doing legitimize his claim to the recently conquered Cintra, also securing an alliance with Skellige. That would put him at a huge advantage in the next upcoming war against the North. Failing to capture actual Ciri, he resorts to introduce a Fake Ciri. As if marrying his own daughter for dynastic claims was not enough -!< 

Later we learn he actually had another plan in mind: >!Emhyr intended to have a son with Ciri - yes - even if it meant raping her and keeping her under guard 24/7 until the birth. He believed his 'advisor' that Ithlinne's Prophecy is true, and that the 'seed that bursts into a new world' will be the son of Emhyr and Ciri, told to rule the future world.!<

It's pretty dark, but serves the overall portrayal of Emhyr as a ruthless emperor who stops at nothing to achieve his goals. >!He succeeds in capturing Geralt and Yennefer, and is close to getting Ciri. This is when Geralt recognizes Duny in him, and there's a conversation about how it all happened and how Emhyr tried to keep it all secret. He ultimately has a change of heart, lets Geralt and Yennefer go and save Ciri.!< His character is pretty well developed despite not showing up 'in person' too much.

Besides Emhyr himself, there's also the whole plot of his 'advisor' and close ally early on who helped him overthrow the Usurper and reclaim his father's throne: >!Vilgefortz. Vilgefortz was the one who instigated Emhyr to come back from Cintra and capture Ciri, Vilgefortz was the one who planted the idea of having a son with her. Vilgefortz was the one who teleported Emhyr out of Sedna and provided the cover story, and the one who helped Emhyr take back the throne. Vilgefortz planned it all along as it would put Ciri closer to him, and let him run his experiments, ultimately playing Emhyr as a pawn as well. Vilgefortz's involvement in high-level Nilfgaard events has to be downplayed if the whole 'seed that bursts into flame' being Emhyr/Ciri son is cut.!<

Seemingly small changes require bigger changes to accomodate them, but them you have to keep cutting or changing stuff because of what you already cut or changed. Some elements are self-contained and easily removed (Bombadil and Glorfindel from LotR), but most of what we've seen so far in the Witcher show has bigger implications.

It's as if the writers don't realize what happens in the later books, or as if they consciously decided to alter and create instead of adapting, and that makes everything considerably more shallow.

It's not about changing stuff to fit a TV series, it's about how they did it - that's why so many are pissed off. They could've done great changes without butchering almost every character left and right to the point that they barely resemble the books. And not to mention some plain plotholes that showed up in the 8 episodes. The writers Lauren brought on just aren't good.

Francesca for example... I'll never understand why they did what they did with her story and character. Absolutely ruined in every aspect. And that's the infuriating thing. If you need to make changes, make them. But at least try not to destroy your characters in the process because if you do that, then what even is left of the books...

And furthermore, it's like they're afraid (or just can't) of making the politics more deeper and complex, as if though they think the audience is dumb and won't understand any of it. They haven't even clarified that Redania is a kingdom and Tretogor it's capital.

urrpkq,i8zoqw8,"True. I admit most of my experience comes from The Witcher III, not the books; I've barely scraped the books- I'm a slow reader. Yet I know, having been i  countless fandoms, the influence of vocal minorities, which can and have even ballooned into majorities. I'm a bit disappointed not just in the current direction but also the data. The vocal minority has admittedly made me very wary of returning to watching.


I'm merely keeping watch from afar and making note of what I have personally seen and heard from fans bigger than I. Same for Doctor Who- since dropping cable and not actively watching the current run, I've heard and read a lot from fans about the current run,and wjat I've seen and heard is for the most part, not good. I don't think that's much of a minority anymore- again just as far as I know. Without keeping up with the show properly, this is about all I can do; I'm largely uninterested in the nitty gritty. 

But there has been a lot of good news too- incredible audios from Big Finish, Russell T. Davies returning, the apparently incredible Ncuti Gatwa being casted as the next Doctor, even the return of David Tennant, Catherine Tate, and even Bernard Cribbins, bless him, are all coming back for the 60th anniversary. I think the majority of the problem lies within the showrunners here. If Netflux can clean up their mess and improve without picking a new showrunner, good for them- people can change and improve. 

But sometimes, they don't and are replaced. Chris Chibnall lied about a 5 year plan and apparently rough drafts of scripts were approved without any revisions to them. It made a complete mess. Things ballooned from ""I don't like the new Doctor being a woman"" to ""wow, most of this writing sucks ass"" and even Chibnall admits it, hoping Davies ignores his changes.

Adding Ciri to the Nivellen story, Yen's backstory and her relationships with Tissaia and Istredd. Fringilla's whole story. I generally love the dialogue between characters dealing with emotional circumstances.

IMO season 1 was a 9/10 and 2 was a 6.5/10. A lot of the issues with season 2 were because they struggled to give Yen something to do while Geralt and Ciri were in Caer Morhen. I get why the TV show couldn't just leave one of the main characters out for so long. This isn't a book where you can be so tightly locked into Geralt's POV, they always would have needed to add story for Yen and Ciri since their POVs are much more prevalent later in the story. The start of Yen's relationship with Ciri has been dramatically altered, but i also think they've set themselves up well to spend next season further developing those relationships to more resemble the status quo in the books. I think this show is at its best when the 3 leads are interacting with each other and welcome more of it.

Henry leaving is sad, his performance has been generally solid but also has the potential to improve things IMO. By his own admission he was responsible for a lot of ad-libbed grunting instead of being verbose and reading the dialogue. Personally, I think that's one of the worse source material deviations.

vvv9tv,ifqc8ul,"If we look at what season 2 did and why it did that, we can conclude a couple of things for season 3.

The source for season 2 was extremely character and relationship driven, but hardly goal or threat driven, with the exception of Geralt looking for the one targeting Ciri. But Ciri and Yennefer, didn't have much tension at all in the source material, which wouldn't have worked for an entire season. So there was a common enemy added, connecting all the storylines.

Another thing that was done in season 2 and partly already in season 1, was setting up all the major players for Thanedd (and afterwards), because the show can't just dump all necessary information on us in a couple of chapters and instead has to set up characters and plot lines over time. That's the reason, why we had Tissaia, Fringilla and Francesca as major characters, to show rather than tell us the different sides of conflict.

So, where does that lead for after Thanedd. Both Geralt and Ciri have clear storyarcs with a clear goal involved. So, I would expect them to stay close to the books. Some events might be arranged in a different order, shortened or extended, but things that happen will mainly be close to the books. There will likely be some additional stakes added to give each season its own sub-goal and climax, as well as some side plot, that might link storylines together, but overall it should be close.

Yennefer's story on the other hand will likely change a lot. She is the only one of the 3 that isn't a main character in the books after Thanedd, and has hardly any story left after all. So, she is pretty much guaranteed to stay a main character and get things to do. The already established connection between her and Francesca will probably be part of that too.

Additionally, I would expect that some of the major side characters will still appear. The show has to regularly show us characters and storylines, when the books could just mention them in a lore bit, or an afterthought. So be prepared for Francesca and Fringilla staying major side characters and someone related to the Readian/Temerian courts like Dijkstra probably joining them.",2,2022-07-11 22:16:21,look season conclude couple things season source season extremely character relationship driven hardly goal threat driven exception geralt looking one targeting ciri ciri yennefer didnt much tension source material wouldnt worked entire season common enemy added connecting storylines another thing done season partly already season setting major players thanedd afterwards show cant dump necessary information us couple chapters instead set characters plot lines time thats reason tissaia fringilla francesca major characters show rather tell us different sides conflict lead thanedd geralt ciri clear storyarcs clear goal involved would expect stay close books events might arranged different order shortened extended things happen mainly close books likely additional stakes added give season subgoal climax well side plot might link storylines together overall close yennefers story hand likely change lot one isnt main character books thanedd hardly story left pretty much guaranteed stay main character get things already established connection francesca probably part additionally would expect major side characters still appear show regularly show us characters storylines books could mention lore bit afterthought prepared francesca fringilla staying major side characters someone related readiantemerian courts like dijkstra probably joining,0.03678160919540229,0.5319628647214854

vvv9tv,ifqffn1,"My problem lies in the fact that tension between Yennefer and Ciri could have been done in other ways too... but they chose the most extreme path forward - Yennefer planning to offer her up as a sacrifice. I don't see how you go from that to a mother-daughter relationship. But remains to be seen.

As for side characters, I love that part of the show, them exploring other factions and characters. Francesca was cast as part of the main cast and I'm all for it... even when they changed so many things about her, she was probably my favorite addition to S2. So seeing more of her, Fringilla, Tissaia and generally the mage factions than we do see in the books is smth I'm looking forward to. The world feels bigger that way.

For one, I'm hoping for a subplot between Emhyr and Francesca - what happened because of Emhyr is smth that's bound to come back to her down the road. Their storyline in the show is in fact much more closely linked after that finale than it is in the books and I hope this is explored at some point. 

I do think Thanedd will be more or less similar to the books, it seems to be Lauren's favorite thing about the stories, but like you said, whilst Geralt and Ciri's paths will probably remain similar, I can't see Yennefer staying on course. She's the show's leading lady. In S1 more so than Ciri. Changes in her story are bound to happen because her book storyline doesn't translate well to the screen where she's one of the leads. And I don't think I'll mind it that much. I want to see her interact more with the lodge, with other sorceresses like Francesca and Philippa... and I do want her show ending to be identical to how she and Geralt ended in the books, but what happens inbetween with her character is not of much concern to me. Sapkowski's writing towards the end did tend to get a little messy when it came to her imo. 

To sum this all up, I do hope they pull off S3 better than they did S2. I hope some things remain same as in the books, like Thanedd or Tissaia's suicide. But the stories following in future seasons after this one don't concern me much. I tend to prefer the first half of the saga anyway. So once they start changing even more down the road when we get to S4, I don't think I'll be that affected.

Then there is also the problem with S2 plot which it did not exist in the book at all....the (in)famous Deathless Mother. Will they simply ignore her in S3? That would just make S2 look bad. It would make it obvious for show only viewers that S2 was some kind of nonsense filler. Which it kind of was but.....do they really wish to be so blatant about it? Its Netflix so....not impossible.

Francesca was clearly set in S2 as being after Ciri too. Which....she was not really in the book. That can throw things a bit around unless they decide to ignore their own S2 ending.

And....there have been many rumours that Vesemir will be back for S3. This I do not know if its only rumours or not....but its out there. I have seen it in a couple places. If true....we know Vesemir was not in the book anymore.

Last but not least, Geralt+Yen+Ciri was not a thing in Time of Contempt. In fact, they never interact much all 3 together in the books.

vvv9tv,ifqe3jm,"Arrested when? I take it you're talking about the end there with Vilgefortz... yeah I agree, I doubt that will happen the way it does in the books. The show made her their leading lady more or less. They're definitely changing her being locked up for such a long period, but that's S4 or S5 so there's still time until then.   
  
As for Tissaia's path, >!I was referring to her suicide after Thanedd. It's clear that in the show, her infatuation with Vilgefortz is what probably leads her to undo his chains during the Thanedd coup when Philippa arrests them. So she's still more or less on track for her storyline, only instead of neutrality, she'll feel torn between Sabrina, Triss, Philippa AND Vilgefortz, her lover in chains. But I do think she'll still commit suicide... or die in S3 in any case.!< Lauren once said that they put an accent on Tissaia & Yennefer's relationship precisely because of how Tissaia ends and that all their choices in regards to Tissaia thus far have been informed by her final fate in the books so... take that how you will.  
  
They can't ignore VM now, obviously. She's practically out of their dimension and no longer a part of Yennefer, Francesca or Fringilla's storyline but I imagine all three will have to address her at some point, especially Yennefer considering what she tried to do. But yeah, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug for the most part.  
  
As for Francesca being after Ciri, I don't see a problem here... in fact, her being after Ciri could be what finally puts her on track with her book storyline, roughly. Istredd is with her, and he seems to like Nilfgaardian politics... Put those two together and I could easily see Istredd guiding Francesca to Aretuza just in time for Thanedd, because she's after Ciri... so she could follow the rough storyline of her bookself. And later on, that same hunt for Ciri will probably be what leads her to Philippa's lodge in the show.  
  
I can't speak about Vesemir. I saw some BTS stuff but that was all from S2. And RI hasn't made any reports on any of the Kaer Morhen witchers filming - I think if they do appear, it will only be in the first episode as a farewell to the trio.  
  
As for the trio, I'm aware they're not together alot in ToC, but the show needs to change this for their own sake. Dedicate at least the first two episodes to just them building their relationships, especially Yennefer with the other two, if they want their separation at Thanedd to have the impact it deserves.",1,2022-07-11 22:28:53,arrested take youre talking end vilgefortz yeah agree doubt happen way books show made leading lady less theyre definitely changing locked long period thats theres still time tissaias path referring suicide thanedd clear show infatuation vilgefortz probably leads undo chains thanedd coup philippa arrests shes still less track storyline instead neutrality shell feel torn sabrina triss philippa vilgefortz lover chains think shell still commit suicide die case lauren said put accent tissaia yennefers relationship precisely tissaia ends choices regards tissaia thus far informed final fate books take cant ignore vm obviously shes practically dimension longer part yennefer francesca fringillas storyline imagine three address point especially yennefer considering tried yeah theyll probably try sweep rug part francesca ciri dont see problem fact ciri could finally puts track book storyline roughly istredd seems like nilfgaardian politics put two together could easily see istredd guiding francesca aretuza time thanedd shes ciri could follow rough storyline bookself later hunt ciri probably leads philippas lodge show cant speak vesemir saw bts stuff ri hasnt made reports kaer morhen witchers filming think appear first episode farewell trio trio im aware theyre together alot toc show needs change sake dedicate least first two episodes building relationships especially yennefer two want separation thanedd impact deserves,0.09913793103448276,0.5574712643678162

Have episodes the way ""supernatural"" does where the characters could learn something but not necessarily be driving to the greater plot. This would serve to slow down the way to rapid pacing and deepen relationships between character and help us all understand the world better. Shit even one episode where anyone takes a Witcher contract would have been nice. Netflix could milk this series for all its worth like that, and build a magnificent story with several seasons. 

I'm a huge Tolkien fan and have read his books several times. When I watch the movies, that do not track the books, it is still very satisfying.

And my main criticism point is the same as yours; there is too much focus on fast action and drama. So much in fact, that they don't lay the proper groundwork for that action and drama to carry emotional weight. The set ups are in my opinion done shoddily and rushed. 

Take Eskel for instance. Without mentioning spoilers here, his role in the plot was meant to carry emotional weight, but he was never properly set up as a character that is very important to Geralt. In interviews in which Lauren is asked why she chose this role for Eskel, she mentions that it was done because he is a well known character from the games (to a lesser degree from the books) and she hoped that his story would carry emotional weight for this reason. She just fully relied on the games and books for Eskel's story to be powerful, rather than building up his character in the show and setting a well-written basis for the emotions we are supposed to feel while following his story arc and how this relates to Geralt. I know Eskel from the games and books, but Lauren's idea failed for me because even if you know a character from elsewhere, a rushed introduction in another medium doesn't automatically mean I care for Eskel right from the start. Especially not because he was portrayed the way he was portrayed. So ultimately, his story felt empty and rushed to me.

I do think I am capable of separating my feelings to a certain extent - I had to do that with games already, as they also took liberties with the source material (of course with them being sequels it was a bit easier :D). Sad as I am to see the changes they've done to the source material, I do think I could enjoy the show on its own.

What I tried to express here was that I wish that the motivations of the characters were clearer and more plausible, the pacing less rushed and the conversations less direct and cliched. It was my impression that perhaps the writers were afraid of making the screenplay too convoluted after some of the reviews of the first season, and that's what led them to simplifying the storylines, jumping from one attraction to the other etc., all in an effort to make the show more fun. I know those elements were there already in the first season, perhaps to a lesser degree, but still - I suspected they made a bargain, exchanging characteriazation depth for a structurally complex storyline and there was still room for some course correction.

I was hoping that if more voices like mine are expressed, they could reach some of the creative team members (not talking about my post specifically, I'm not that vain, but a more gerneral impression one can get from skimming thrugh social networking sites, it seems like there are some similar sentiments on this and other subs already). Then maybe the writers would feel more inclined to write a bit more complicated scripts. I do believe there is a huge audience for such shows - the great success of the first 4 season of GoT can be a proof here, and the almost universal dissatisfaction towards the final season of the same show would provide further evidance to substantiate my claim. :)

Then again, from what u/Parigold wrote, quoting Alik Sakharov, it seems that what I perceive as fatal flaws of the show, may actually be part of a their strategy from the beginning, in other words, they are deliberately writing shallow stories and concentrating only on the spectacle, with little consideration of character development and plausibility.",3,2021-12-23 03:26:29,thank sharing experience others enjoy show power dont want spoil experience wanted share mine think capable separating feelings certain extent games already also took liberties source material course sequels bit easier sad see changes theyve done source material think could enjoy show tried express wish motivations characters clearer plausible pacing less rushed conversations less direct cliched impression perhaps writers afraid making screenplay convoluted reviews first season thats led simplifying storylines jumping one attraction etc effort make show fun know elements already first season perhaps lesser degree still suspected made bargain exchanging characteriazation depth structurally complex storyline still room course correction hoping voices like mine expressed could reach creative team members talking post specifically im vain gerneral impression one get skimming thrugh social networking sites seems like similar sentiments subs already maybe writers would feel inclined write bit complicated scripts believe huge audience shows great success first season got proof almost universal dissatisfaction towards final season show would provide evidance substantiate claim uparigold wrote quoting alik sakharov seems perceive fatal flaws show may actually part strategy beginning words deliberately writing shallow stories concentrating spectacle little consideration character development plausibility,0.16374338624338625,0.5104761904761905

15yy1s2,jxip1yb,"The decrease of s3 would be 43.77% compared to s2 (if we compare them on their first 6 weeks)

If we compare first 6 weeks of both seasons it would be like this:

s2: 142 430 000 (w1) + 168 460 000 (w2) + 94 270 000 (w3) + 57 340 000 (w4) + 34 350 000 (w5) + 22 640 000 (w6) = 519 490 000

s3: 73 000 000 (w1) + 66 500 000 (w2) + 32 100 000 (w3) + 20 100 000 (w4) + 59 000 000 (w5) + 41 400 000 (w6) = 292 100 000

So in 6 weeks, s2 got 519 490 000 vs 292 100 000 for s3, the decrease for s3 is 43.77% compared to s2.

Now if we compare s2 (6 weeks) vs s3 (8 weeks) the drop of s3 would be 36.84% (minus 2 weeks of s2)

So the estimation drop rate of s3 would likely be around 40% compared to s2 (if we added week 7 and 8 of s2).

Also if we want to compare s3 vs s1, the drop rate would be even much higher, [since the viewership (for the first month) of s1 was 541 000 000 vs 484 300 000 for s2](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/netflixs-biggest-hit-movies-and-shows-ranked-according-to-netflix/), so s2 got a 10.48% drop compared to s1, and since s3 have a 40% drop compared to s2, this will mean that s3 will have a 60% drop compared to s1.",6,2023-08-24 12:49:58,"decrease would compared compare first weeks compare first weeks seasons would like weeks got vs decrease compared compare weeks vs weeks drop would minus weeks estimation drop rate would likely around compared added week also want compare vs drop rate would even much higher since viewership first month 00 vs 484 300 000 s2](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/netflixs-biggest-hit-movies-and-shows-ranked-according-to-netflix/), s2 got 10.48% drop compared s1, since s3 40% drop compared s2, mean s3 60% drop compared s1.",0.08392857142857144,0.46964285714285714

This is the result of a lot of things being messed up from the books. 

. book Geralt hated his mother for abandoning him. 

. It is hinted that she might have abandoned him because mages are scared about their possible offspring. Other mages might prefer her baby dead if they knew about him. 

. The entire fertility trade for magic does not exist in the books at all. It is said that at some point Tissaia did want to sterilize all magic users (not only female and not only her school). Its never confirmed in the books if she ever did anything anywhere near it. 

. the obvious conclusion is that book mages are indeed fertile when they are young. If not...there would be no need for Tissaia to be scared about it. 

. the logical consequence in the books is just that they stop being fertile in result of age and use of magic. Some of them might be naturally more resistant vs others. 

. there is nothing about Visenna´s death in the books. Geralt will never see her again after his big injury which was depicted in Season 1 and which did happen in the books. They did meet that time and that time only in the books.

159vsf3,jtj8emv,"In the books mages are immortal because of an elixer they take to stop the ageing process. Magic is supposed to make them healthier though in general so they may also naturally age slower and live longer. For example Neneke knew Geralt when he was a child and is still alive and kicking even though Geralt is supposed to be over 100 years old when he first meets Ciri. Priests aren't mages obviously but they do have magical abilities in the witcher world as do Druids. Another example of this is that Triss must be around 40 when she is first introduced but she isn't described as looking middle aged. Yet how can she have taken the elixer if she's allergic to potions? It's possible mages developed some other way of stopping the aging process, or Triss just ages slower. 

Mages don't get sterilised in return for beauty and immortality in the books. Instead magic just seems to naturally make mages sterile but not all the time and its implied Tissaia sterilises her students on purpose. We don't know if Visenna studied at aretuza. She was initially described as a druidess but then when she was included in the witcher books she became a sorceress. It's possible she's both.

**Character breakdown:**

More Central Characters

>**Picadilly:** A prince and something of a socialite in this world. This character will have quite a bit of confidence, and there is a good chance he is only looking out for number one. It appears he understands the machinations of upward social mobility, something that could make him very dangerous.  
>  
>**Marylebone:** A female who will have a much harder edge to her overall persona. It looks like this new \[new as in newly introduced\] character will be a scrapper, someone who has all the confidence in the world but has been forged out of a shrouded past in a world that’s been anything but forgiving.

Recurring Characters

>**Hampstead:** An older woman who doesn’t appear to be the fighting type. Instead, she’s navigating the world of the Royal Court.  
>  
>**Greenwich:** A popular soldier who has become a man of the people.  
>  
>**Parsons:** A woman whose past is a mystery because she is suffering from amnesia. Though her backstory does hold secrets to the series.  
>  
>**Maida Vale:** She is part of a group of powerful women. She is set to fill up the screen in her scenes.  
>  
>**Angel:** A messenger to the king who has seen more than his share of atrocities along the way.

**M**arylebone gives me a pretty clear **M**ilva feeling, which would mean that we get the start of the Hansa next season! No idea about the others yet.

Edit: With [this article](https://www.theilluminerdi.com/2022/02/16/the-witcher-season-3-characters/) claiming that Netflix is hopeing for a LGBTQ+ for the role it is much more likely that **M**arylebone is actually **M**istle.

Marylebone: either a Lodge member (Keira, possibly) or, as someone else pointed out, Milva. My hope? She is Julia ""Pretty Kitty"" Abatemarco.

Greenwich: either Dennis Cranmer (but he should be a dwarf), Jon Natalis, Adam ""Adieu"" Pangratt (see above my theory about Julia) or Isengrim (again, the character should not be a human).

Parsons: a different take on fake Ciri/""poor little Reason of State""...or maybe Joanna ""Kenna"" Selborne from Skellen's gang, but that's stretching her background (both in the timeline and relevance).

15hp71d,juq6tob,"I agree. My favourite season so far. I now understand a lot of the changes they made for season 1 and 2. It made a lot of the events in season 3 have more impact, emotionality and relatability.

I felt more attached to the rag tag family in the show than in the books. You can really feel Yennefer and Ciris motherly bond elevated this season. Whereas in the books, that bond was mostly written in instead of felt. 

From season 1 and 2, i was a little skeptical about how they gave so much importance to Yennefer and Tissaia's relationship. But in the end, it was to make Ciri and Yennefer have a deeper meaning because Yens motherly instincts had come from her teacher. 

I knew it was coming, but Tissaia's last scenes had me bawling. I never felt that in the books as her demise there had no emotional impact for me. But in the show, the way she used the line, ""a flower is just a flower, and the best thing it can do for us is die"" was such a poetic way to go. I couldn't hold back my tears.

I think this was the best season yet. I had gripes about the changes they made for season 1 and 2. But i understand why they went this direction. 

As a parent who is now on his 30's, i feel way more attached to this world now than I was as a teenager nerding about the games and the books. It really pulls on my heartstrings as I would do anything and everything to protect and provide for my family.

This season was the closest to the essence of the books than it has ever been. I keep asking myself why aren't the book fans talking more about it. So now, i'm concluding that this is mostly about the anger of Henry leaving. Had he stayed with the show, I think the fans of the books would be singing praises for this season. 

Henry advocated for the show to be closer to the books, but he leaves the moment the show is finally being steered in the right direction. To be honest, I wish they cast a different actor who could stay committed. Henry is an in demand actor and i understand if he can't commit because of his other projects.

15hp71d,juq88o0,"Me too. 

The additional character setup is now paying off. The parallels between Tissia and Yen / Yen and Ciri are particularly improved from the books. 

I find show Philippa much more intriguing than in the books. I feel like the books told us she was intimidating and impressive but then didn't really deliver on that front. Her dynamic with show Dijkstra is very interesting. 

I also really like that we see that Thannedd didn't just break Dijkstra's leg and knee, but his confidence as a spy master too. He didn't know wtf was really going on. No one did (mainly because the characters on screen are still figuring out that while Vilgefortz is working *with* Emhyr for now, V does not work *for* E. He has his own game)  

Joey Batey continues to delight, and I can't wait until we get the Hanza and his early drafts of *100 Years of Poetry*. 

Ending with Ciri making her first deliberate human kill and being so numb to it was a fantastic ending point. The arc of this season was Geralt and Yen training her and also guiding her as she desperately wanted to fight back and gain some agency. They warned her not to be too quick to jump into a fight, and deliberately taking a life is a Big Deal. Now we see the pay off of her ignoring all that advice for a while.",7,2023-08-04 13:24:49,additional character setup paying parallels tissia yen yen ciri particularly improved books find show philippa much intriguing books feel like books told us intimidating impressive didnt really deliver front dynamic show dijkstra interesting also really like see thannedd didnt break dijkstras leg knee confidence spy master didnt know wtf really going one mainly characters screen still figuring vilgefortz working emhyr work game joey batey continues delight cant wait get hanza early drafts years poetry ending ciri making first deliberate human kill numb fantastic ending point arc season geralt yen training also guiding desperately wanted fight back gain agency warned quick jump fight deliberately taking life big deal see pay ignoring advice,0.13484848484848488,0.4825757575757576

15hp71d,jvhp9h8,"Mainly agree.

Season 1 was good, but the overall storyline was a bit lacking at parts and some of the Monster of the week episodes didn't really work that well.

Still not convinced by season 2. I still like the things I liked back when watching it first (Francesca, Fringilla, Tissaia), but the main storyline still has me puzzled. Maybe the payoff will just come later.

Season 3 learned from the mistakes of season 2 (and 1), kept closer to the books, and showed the whole family part really well.

Tissaia's last moment didn't really work that well for me in the show. She was one of the best characters in the show. But everything that made her more human and 3dimensional robbed her of some of the power and mystery she had in the books, which made her end more tragic. In the show the whole conspiration part felt a bit too fast and lacked impact compared to the books and thus her role too. In the book, her decision seems to be a direct result of her feeling guilty of freeing Vilgefortz. In the show her decision seems much more reasonable, and her demise seems to be far too removed from the events of Thanedd themselves.

Yennefer’s entire character arc is a *terrible* change. But changes that worked were things like having Ciri in A Grain of Truth. Removing the washing scene was another good change, since Ciri’s fear was already present with Cahir. 

As far as the Rats, I’m betting they’ll be changed into some generic Robinhood trope. Which would be another bad change, because these children literally represent the children of war. They are what happen when war ravages a land, society breaks apart, and people are reverted to animalistic survival instincts. We shouldn’t like them, because we shouldn’t like the results of war.

If I had to bet, the season climaxes with the coup, and doesn't really go into the full rats story yet. Though it is possible that we see some level of introduction to them as actors separate to Ciri.

Now speaking personally, I really hope they cull as much of the weird sexualization of Ciri as possible. Sapkowksi's weird turn towards some really creepy writing for his female characters, and especially Ciri, began with the rats. And it just kept getting weirder. The fact that literally everyone wants to rape her started to grate after a while. It's honestly crap writing.

So frankly, I hope they cull as much as they can. Give the damn villains some variety. It's great that the northern kings seem hellbent on killing her so far, because atleast it's different from all of them wanting the same thing. My hope is that they'll throw in some variety for the wild hunt too.

How does that relate to the rats? I'm not sure yet. I don't think they'll be writing the relationship as nearly as Stockholm as the books were because I really don't think the show is built to handle that with the nuance and complexity it deserves.

vlw2qn,idyo70y,"I said this in post about their fight before and why I like the moment so much. 

***SPOILERS***

What I love about their fight is that leading up to it Sapkowski has conditioned the reader to expect Geralt to win all his fights. He’s killed hitmen, professional swordsmen, monsters, and even right before this he massacred a commando of scoia’tael elves. So we naturally expect him to take this as well. Then the narrative abruptly switches to a few weeks later. Geralt being alive we expected him to have won his fight, but the final sentence in that passage tells us the opposite. Not only did the guy we are used to steamrolling in most of his fights lose, but he got absolutely fucked up.

>	“Your arrogance, Geralt. I will disabuse you of arrogance. And I will do so with the help of this magic staff here.”

>	“The Witcher squinted and raised his blade a little.

>	‘I’m trembling with impatience.’

>	*A few weeks later*, having been healed by the dryads and the waters of Brokilon, Geralt wondered what mistakes he had made during the fight. And came to the conclusion he hadn’t made any. His only mistake was made before the fight. **He ought to have fled before it even began**.”

166oshf,jypdgt0,"I understand it. One of the big crutches they had from Day 1 is that Yennefer is really in and out of the story in the books and the games. Geralt and eventually Ciri are the main consistent characters. They decided to expand Yennefer's role considerably in season 1, making a whole mage plotline that was barely there in the books at times and getting her involved in politics that she did not care at all about in the games or the books. There was probably a mandate from Netflix to made the show ""more like Game of Thrones"" which has a larger rotating cast of characters and more politics, so the show couldn't be all Geralt killing monsters (though it would have been a better show). So they poured a lot into Yennefer and her relationship with the other mages, made her the hero of Sodden (she wasn't at Sodden in the books), made her really care about what the Brotherhood thought of her, and made her the head of the Conclave.

>And in ep 8 what was the meaning of Yen's letter? Did she and Geralt split up? Did she choose to stay in Aretuza and not go after Ciri?

Yes, they split up. Yennefer is more useful in Aretuza using political power and influence to get Ciri back, given that she was a curt mage for 30 years, played a key role in Nilfgaards defeat at Sodden Hill and has many friends in positions of power.

Same. I enjoyed the earlier seasons' helpings of bosom but I've also been enjoying the plot. I had more of a problem with them having Triss have brown hair in ssn 1 than I did any other casting decision. 🙃 

I have enjoyed the menace Phillipa has seemed to radiate (even as an owl for those that knew who she was) so I have had no problems with any of the castings at all. 

I'm not feeling that Cavill leaving ruined the show for me. I was going to watch it to whatever conclusion they give it (and any spinoffs they devise) because I -love- the -Witcher- universe, books, series and most recently the games as I got Witcher 3 for my nephew and started playing it too. I think It's great that he cares about the story and I agree that he did an -amazing- job with it. 

As for Liam, I'm with you, I'm going to withhold any judgement on him until I actually see what he is going to do with the role. I hope he does a good job because he has some hella big shoes to fill.

It feels like they're trying to make up for the shitty season 2 by including the original material from BoE, which is funny because they didn't do it in season 2 lol. Still, I think Geralt had great fight scenes, Yennefer was back in character, Ciri is killing it and Jaskier is finally more than just comedy relief. Which is why I enjoyed episode 1 a lot.

14mh06o,jq78ezc,"It's a different time nowadays. You probably enjoyed the books just as much as I did. I love them, although I agree that the ending chapter kinda sucks. I also expected my family members to be amazed just as I was, but that doesn't always happen (and it also infuriates me).

&#x200B;

But, the last year of literall social media war between 'books & games' and 'netflix show' fans has uncovered something. Right on this very sub, I read that Witcher books are not great.....not even very good....juts average fantasy, that wishes it could reach the greatness of ASoIaF.  Or that the Hussite trilogy by Sapkowski is superior (I promise I will read it some day).

&#x200B;

So I guess it's no surprise the watch party wasn't hooked.....turns out it was just 'average' all along..... My point is, the Witcher is not such a phenomena like the GoT was. IMO,  everyone was a fan of GoT because everyone arround them was. Me, I was just a teen at that time and we didn't even have HBO at home, so I never watched it when it was 'fresh'. Then a few years later, I tried to watch it and lost interest after Season 3 episode 3. Which is strange, since I love the Witcher I should've loved the GoT aswell....right? Well, that's not the case as you can see.

&#x200B;

Of course, that doesn't mean that this adaptation is good. It definately could've been much better. My point is, not everyone likes the same things as others. If the Witcher is to become another phenomenal show like GoT, you would have to achieve perfection on the level of The Last of Us, Stranger Thing or Arcane.

In the overall story its pretty mehhhh

At this point in time the trio should be ready to be split because their emotional connection should be well established. Which it isnt in the series.

Them being split in the books works in order to heighten the emotional side of the story. Its like in LOTR. You understand the several parts of the fellowship have a deep commitment to helping each other because you understand how much they care about each other. And even tough they are only re-united at the very end, they are always working towards helping each other in some way.

Witcher 3 used this very same trope by the way. Most of the game the trio is split and just trying to cooperate without knowing what is happening with each other. Which, again, heightens the emotional charge. Because we can understand they are concerned with each other and its quite scary if they are not around to see what the others are going through. Witcher 3 does this mainly with Geralt and Ciri.

As a TV example, we have of course GoT. GoT managed in a single episode (plus some bits all around season 1) to establish connections between the Stark kids. So much so that people cry when some of them finally re-unite after 7 seasons or so. This is good writing ;)

Geralt´s connection with Yen is established already in The Last Wish ;)

Because...in the Voice of Reason chapters you realize Geralt was hurt in the Stryga fight due to him being emotionally unstable. Which....he is so because of Yennefer ;)

Plus, in the same Voice of Reason chapters, its pretty clear Geralt is going after big dangerous contracts because he is collecting money to.....try and buy some fertility cure for Yennefer ;)

Yes, this is all already in The Last Wish :)

Also, in Sword of Destiny Geralt very much goes suicidal because he loves Yen (Shard of Ice). He also is constantly thinking about Yen when having another relationship with Essi (Little Sacrifice). There is a lot of talk about Yennefer from Geralt in Sword of Destiny. And last but not least, it was actually Yennefer in the books who told Geralt to go rescue Ciri from Cintra ;) Because....yes....they had a meeting in Sword of Destiny which apparently the series is going to move all the way forward into....Season 3? (Belleteyn).

So, again, this makes things so ironic considering your comments lol

Not really. I am pointing out that Yen and Ciri get close when Yen is the teacher of Ciri by taking her from the temple and traveling around with her which has not happened anywhere in season 2 and would be end of book 1 and more as an epilogue, aka in a time jump where they already spent a longer  time together in that bonding relationship.

So it is about where season 2 correlates to the books and which steps obviously haven't happened that make Yen and Ciri bond.

Has Yen taught Ciri? No. Where does it happen? Time jump end of book 1. Has Ciri stayed at the temple? No. Where does it happen? End of book 1. Have they met before in the books in any personal capacity making a sensible meeting for Yennefer to develop motherly feelings? At least not that I remember. It is the teacher pupil time that builds their bond.

All that must happen in season 3 but people complaining about it not being in season 2 when it obviously cuts off before any correlating developments that just is not valid.

Because....if not....then the question will be: What book do you think Season 2 was trying to adapt?

Given that Ciri and Yen do have their relationship fully built in Blood of Elves. You saying that its at the end of the book....well....its still a lot of pages ;) It´s entire months going around with them together at the Temple :)

And timeline wise it gets tricky because a lot of what is happening with Yen + Ciri is happening at the same time as Geralt´s further adventures in Blood of Elves. It´s just that because its a book you get to read most of Geralt´s point of view first. But events are actually happening more or less at the same time.

Like....Ciri gets a vision of Geralt being in danger which is pretty much the end of Geralt´s adventure in Blood of Elves. But when Ciri gets this vision, she has already been with Yen a ton of time and they are already very close together.

And just for people who might not know, Ciri + Yen page counter in Blood of Elves is likely between 25% to 30% of the entire book :) Yes, its very much the final act of the book but its still quite a bit.

This is all incredibly ironic because Lauren and her team apparently had trouble adapting Blood of Elves. They seem to have thought that it was not so well suited for TV.

Also I make a very specific claim that you somehow you blow up into some unrestricted defense of anything concerning the show. It is not. It is about one complaint (Yen would not do this because she has a bond with her) which based on timing in the show is invalid.

Plainly things that happened in the book that are the basis of Yen+Ciri bond have not happened in season 2.

Do I want them to happen? Yes.

Is it bad they have not happened, yet? No.

Is it proper to say season 2 adapts Blood of Elves in total but has not actually done that, hence it cannot put these things now in season 3? No.

:/

You either really need to reread the books or are purposefully coming up with a ridiculous excuse for season 2.

Blood of Elves (book 1 of the saga) which seasons 2 was supposedly adapting:

Geralt writes a letter to Yennefer (who has never met Ciri), asking her for help, Yennefer **accepts**, she trains Ciri, they bond. Absolutely no killing of Ciri involved. The book ends **after** they spend months together and are effectively a mother and daughter.

Series:

Everything is completely derailed; Geralt has no idea what's going on with Yen, she just shows up, tries to kill Ciri.

Your entire argument is as asinine as adapting Harry Potter books by having Dumbledore show up instead of Hagrid in the first movie, taking Harry to Voldemort for shits and giggles and then claiming ""oH bUt ThEy sTiLl hAvEnT sHoWeD tHe pArt wHeRe tHey BoNd!""

>Plainly things that happened in the book that are the basis of Yen+Ciri bond have not happened in season 2.

Because of the way they decided to add and change the plot not because of timing, genius.

>Is it bad they have not happened, yet? No.

In the books, Yen and Ciri's relationship goes from strangers to mother and daughter.

Because of what happened in season 2, they are currently at 'enemies' level of closeness.

Do you not understand how that's a pretty shitty position to place two leads who are supposed to have such a special connection only to then have to **fix** their relationship?

x6hob6,in7dus9,"Honestly people were panicking about the Wild Hunt, saying it was too soon, and it would make no sense. But I think the pacing to introduce them was pretty good.

If S3 goes right up to Thanedd, they might end up with half an episode of Ciri wandering before meeting the rats.

There is however another possibility. They still need to explore Ciri's magic. And we've seen that her magic allows you to plumb the past. IIRC correctly, part of the magical suite that is Elder Blood powers also includes prophesizing. It is possible that the Rats might not formally be introduced, but could feature as something of a precognitive vision for Ciri over the course of the episode. After all, if she sees them in a vision, as a way of setting up her reactions to them when she formally meets them, the ""interaction"" still needs to be shot right?

x6hob6,in6xvw3,"Yennefer is a 90-year-old woman, highly educated and trained at probably the best sorceress academy out there. Being manipulated and influenced by a demon is smth that should never have happened to a witch of her caliber, her age and her experience. So no, she wasn't simply manipulated. It was a deal - give me the girl and I give you your magic. She knew what she was doing.

Fringilla is an example of someone who was manipulated constantly because VM was whispering in her head the entire time until she lost it and killed all those generals. Francesca on the other hand knew fully well that this was a demon yet went along with it cause it was for the survival of the elves. And Yennefer was in between. Not as easily manipulated as Fringilla but also not going along with it until she became absolutely desperate.

If it was Keira Metz or Triss or some young sorceress, then maybe it would even make sense (even though I don't think that Triss in the show would've went along with it) that they fell prey to this. But not for Yennefer.

And Geralt didn't abandon her in a shed or a hut - she was a princess of a kingdom and had the perfect life. He went to get her when Cintra was about to fall... so his negligence doesn't compare to Yennefer trying to sacrifice her at all - those are two incredibly different situations. He wasn't actively harming her. Yennefer was.

I still hope they can use the beginning of S3 to fix this fracture though. They have the time for it.

x6hob6,in703bv,"Thank you!! I was wondering was the cake means low key 💀 but I googled it and figured it out haha 

While Yennefer is very intelligent she was shown to be easily manipulated by the Djinn shit she almost killed herself there so I don’t think it’s far off to think Voleth Meir got to her quite a bit. 

I def agree she’s the middle ground between Fringilla’s heavily influenced mind and Francesca’s “I don’t give a shit who tf this old woman is” vibes. Got the scene with the generals when Fringilla is hearing the voice the entire time — chills. Such a good scene. 

I also think this ties into a way Yennefer in the show differs strongly from the books — she has a younger energy than the books. She feels more like a peer to Triss in the show than anything. 

I think a lot of this comes from Cavill being so much older than Chalotra (which btw the Hollywood trope of much older male co star and very young female co star is so gross) and no matter how they play the characters or how it’s written they still have a 13 year age difference and we can’t ignore that. 

I adore how Chalotra has played Yen but she is definitely younger and much more impulsive than the Yen we know in the books. But also Yen in the books has a lot more mystery surrounding her. We don’t see as much of her life and backstory as we do in the show. 

Agreed they have time to fix it in S3!! What they really need to do in S3 is just breathe for an episode. Really take some time and just have a filler where you are developing relationships.

14qslc1,jqp17hc,"1. Its just a poorly written side plot. They gave too much importance very early to Francesca and the elves and now they have to write a completely original story. She isn't suppose to be a rebel at this point, she should be at the banquet with everyone else as a high ranking mage. 

2. This is a plothole in the show. Yen doesn't notice her missing and Geralt just happens to be there when Ciri needs to be saved. Or Yennefer knows about Ciri running away to Geralt, she just doesn't go after her. It's a very sloppy mess. In the books Yen and Ciri knew where Geralt is (told by the banker) and Ciri leaves a note to Yennefer before she sneaks out saying she wants to see Geralt one more time before enlisting to Aretuza. Yen reads the letter and goes after Ciri. Geralt is staying at a farmhouse sees Ciri being chased by the hunt. Ciri is saved by Yennefer who just caught up to Ciri just in time and dispelled the hunt with a powerful spell.

3. So in the books you don't see the hunt at any point up until now (none of the wild hunt scenes from season 2 were in the books) but you got some snippets about it. The author in previous books sets them up as an inexplicable phenomenon. A cavalcade of spectral riders, riding through the skies and kidnapping people, making them join their ranks. In the books it was the first time we got to see the wild hunt so there it didnt serve the purpose to remind you but rather to show you that they actually exist and they want Ciri. The scene of them appearing was set up really nicely by the author. Ciri rode out in the night, a storm is approaching, her horse gets scared, she thinks she is lost, she slowly getting haunted by bad memories, Cintra, the kinght with the winged helmet, Shaerrawedd, etc. Just in general reading the scene you get this eerie feeling that something is hanging in the air, then the hunt appears. Their apperence felt appropriate and you get the first sign that the hunt will have a greater importance down the line.

edit: So another reason why the Ciri is missing/wild hunt attack scenes felt out of place was because in the books at this stage Yennefer and Geralt haven't seen each other for years, and Ciri haven't seen Geralt for months. The wild hunt attack scene was also served as a reunion that as a reader you wanted since a book and a half. This was the first time ever Geralt Yennefer and Ciri got to be together. In the show they've been just separated and reunited again like what after a few days?

3. Yes, this is the first time they show up in the books. It is never explained why on text but you can kind of extrapolate. Since the sack of Cintra Ciri had never been completely alone for long. So this might be the first time they could feel an opportunity might exist. May also be that they are watching around Gors Velen like everyone else and their dogs ;)  In the books they are not very capable in the Continent World. So what they can do is quite limited. In the books both Geralt and Yen have been fairly competent protecting Ciri up to this point in the story. And we do not know if the Wild Hunt ever showed up anywhere near Ciri immediately after the sack of Cintra. Book Ciri is a bit traumatized and never told exactly what happened till she got to the farmers where eventually Geralt found her. It´s a very strong possibility that Ciri´s location has remained a mystery to the Wild Hunt since the sack of Cintra.

14qslc1,jqqgi4b,"> but in the show it works

It wasn't logical writing even from the shows point of view. For 2 episodes they tried to hammer in our heads that Yennefer is doing everything for Ciri. She promised Geralt she will keep her safe etc. And now we don't even see her being conflicted wheter she should go after Ciri or not. Just a passing comment to Triss that Geralt will bring her to Aretuza. She might have heard Ciri talking to the enchanted coin calling for Geralt but even then how does Geralt can hear that and how can he reply to Ciri? How can Yennefer be sure that Ciri can make the multiple days journey? How can she be sure that Geralt will find Ciri?

From your letter it appears that you have lived a peaceful, wonderfully boring life, devoid of all sensation. These days such a life is a real privilege, dear friend, and I am happy that you have managed to achieve it*.

Vapid troll comment.  I'm guessing you're a shill for this show.

I only complain about things that I am invested in and then subvert my expectations. I complained about the GITS movie when it came out several years ago, and holy shit was the forum for that IP flooded with corporate trolls trying to justify whitewashing and how the movie did not need to conform in any way to the original IP.

edit - 

1) disappointed that a mod would use their powers to reply to a user that had blocked them.  Did not expect a notification of a reply.

2) Calling someone a shill when they are a shill is not a maturity issue, except from the corporation sending the legions of shills.  In the GITS forum, there were dozens of accounts that had been made about 1 year prior to the release of the movie, had a dozen or so comments to the account, went inactive for the next 11 months, and then suddenly all began participating in the GITS forum.  Many of them were deleted months afterward, ostensibly to erase traces of their behavior.  Immature indeed.  All of this was extremely noticeable because there were only a couple thousand subscribers to that sub to begin with.  There are graveyards of deleted users and comments in the GITS forum around the time of the movie.",5,2023-07-30 12:10:20,lets hope youre one people hates something much spend time complaining said thing online vapid troll comment im guessing youre shill show complain things invested subvert expectations complained gits movie came several years ago holy shit forum ip flooded corporate trolls trying justify whitewashing movie need conform way original ip edit disappointed mod would use powers reply user blocked expect notification reply calling someone shill shill maturity issue except corporation sending legions shills gits forum dozens accounts made year prior release movie dozen comments account went inactive next months suddenly began participating gits forum many deleted months afterward ostensibly erase traces behavior immature indeed extremely noticeable couple thousand subscribers sub begin graveyards deleted users comments gits forum around time movie,-0.024999999999999994,0.4625

Show Geralt (S1) mostly communicated in Hmms and fucks or a snappy comeback. Book Geralt is very clever and verbose. He’s basically an amateur philosopher, often engaging in intricate conversation with people on how they perceive the world around them. While the hmm’s and fucks were funny, it kinda limits what they can do with the character. This would be fine if the show didn’t want to take itself seriously and be just a simple campy action fantasy show, but it clearly wants to be more than that, so things likely had to change. I’ve seen folks compare S1 Geralt’s dialogue to that of a caveman compared to how talkative he technically should be if we go by his book counterpart.

Multi layered-subterfuge: when not only is the character tricking another character, but the showmaker also tricks the audience.

An example of this is the first episode of Dexter's newest season when **SPOILERS**

His cop girlfriend pulls him over and goes through the motions for a normal traffic stop. Dexter looks worried. This makes the audience think he's about to be busted for all his killings, when in a few seconds it's revealed they're a couple and it's just part of their foreplay. Thing is, it makes no sense for Dexter to look worried if he knows the cop's about to jump his bones, so it's a cheap method of tricking the audience with something that makes no sense in-universe.

They did the same with Vilgefortz. It makes no sense in-universe for Vilgefortz to throw the fight ( he would've just avoided Cahir altogether ) but they use it to trick the audience into thinking he's weak when in Season 3 he'll beat the piss out of Geralt.",3,2021-12-28 22:57:52,thats case would lose fight cahir purpose multi layeredsubterfuge character tricking another character showmaker also tricks audience example first episode dexters newest season spoilers cop girlfriend pulls goes motions normal traffic stop dexter looks worried makes audience think hes busted killings seconds revealed theyre couple part foreplay thing makes sense dexter look worried knows cops jump bones cheap method tricking audience something makes sense inuniverse vilgefortz makes sense inuniverse vilgefortz throw fight wouldve avoided cahir altogether use trick audience thinking hes weak season hell beat piss geralt,0.032142857142857154,0.5047619047619047

About Lydia though, I think she alludes to the fact that Vilgefortz works for himself - so Rience would not be answering to Emhyr.

So they had to rework things to add that climax or excitement in every episode. There was also his statement iirc saying there’s basically a new monster in every episode in S2, despite the books not actually having much monster slaying and Blood of Elves probably has the least amount of action out of all the books.

I agree and think that tv shows can really shine when they take the time to develop and focus on their characters. It takes longer to do than have a cool action sequence which is why you would think a tv show would have an edge over a movie in this regard. 

My worst fear is that the show team thinks that a significant portion of their viewers watch the show for action and monster slaying (which could be true). They have set the expectation that this show isn’t about characters talking, character arcs, relationship building, and if it is it is only secondary to the action.

I expect the first half to follow the book in broad strokes at least- that is, >!Cahir (and probably Fringilla as well) getting released from prison to capture Ciri, Triss teaming up with Philippa (I think they set this up by having her disappointed in Tissaia), probably a bit of Yen training Ciri, and just generally getting everybody to Thanedd somehow!<. Geralt probably will do some monster slaying on the way. They'll add something for Jaskier to do, and songs, of course. Then have the big explosion (I really hope they'll keep the essence of that and not turn it into a CGI monster fest).

After that, all bets are off. I could easily see them inventing completely new stuff, and I think in Yen's case that's pretty much a certainty. I imagine Ciri will still end up >!separated from the others and with the rats!< but how they'll get there I don't know (considering she's already pretty good at creating portals and they gave ""lose magic after drawing from fire"" to Yen).

It can be explained that in the books Ciri knew Geralt´s location and it was actually nearby. Which is also the reason why she decided to flee in the first place. Because she knows where to go and its near in the books ;)

Also, Book Yennefer did run after her!

The Wild Hunt did show up in the books too but it was Geralt + Yennefer vs them. And Yennefer can conjure some pretty bad ass spells.

Jaskier had just come to be with Geralt so he was indeed around. Once again, this is all possible because Geralt was pretty near the big city of Gors Velen. So everyone and their dogs kind of expected all of them to be around there.

The boat scene? Well....that exists in the books but it was copy pasted from a different point in the story lol And it was Geralt alone in that book scene. No Ciri and no Jaskier were there on the boat.

In short, the writers of this show are like a bunch of high school kids playing with Microsoft Word and copy paste function.

P.S.: As for the timeline in the books. Its not explicit because none says that she started going at 21h, arriving at 22h :) But given the events I would say her book ride took less than 1 hour.

14t0eo1,jrddhh9,"This is bugging the hell out of me too. I just finished ep. 3 and I've gone back twice thinking I missed something. The third time I just said fuck it, knowing this is apparently how they're choosing to do the story. There seems to be much more telling than showing this season. They'll just dump a scene on you and then fill you on what's going on later or have you intuit the rest.

The scene you're talking about, I was sure that was a dream or something. Between the bad cgi and the fact that Ciri was in the town with Yennefer but then she's racing away with a horse (where did she even get a horse?) but they never showed anything to suggest she left, plus shadowy wild hunt people, who last we saw were in/on a different shere, made my think it wasn't real. I also didn't think she'd be that fucking stupid,  although apparently I was giving her too much credit, especially since she's been doing stupid shit consistently this season. 

Then of course there's Geralt's deus ex machina moment. Which, ok, she called to him, but is that talisman basically a magical cell phone? They can apparently communicate, and it gives him her exact location? It's all just very convenient. Especially since he was supposedly a bit of a ways away. 

I'm also a bit frustrated with some of the lack of common sense. For instance, mages can create illusions. Why wouldn't Yennefer change their appearances? Or at the very least there has to be some kind of dye they can use on Ciri and Geralts hair, right? Even Yarpen mentions this but they don't bother. Hell they had Yen wear a mask to the festival but not Ciri or Geralt, cause that makes sense. Everyone and their mother wants Ciri but she has to keep drawing attention and wandering off. 

Yen and Ciri need a portal that can't be traced, so rather than have Ciri bleed a little to get the feainnewedd (or idk taking some before they left knowing they'd be hunted and might need to escape quickly and an untracable portal might come in handy) they do all this other shit. Why didn't Yennefer think of that?

Which is part of the reason why I get so much karma.

I am just spreading love for the books. That the show managed to look bad in comparison is not really my doing.

I do notice that some show fans seem to get mad when I spread love for the books. But really....direct your anger somewhere else. Because its not because of me that the show makes you look bad when compared to the books. That´s not entirely my fault.

idbsba,g288gjr,"Coming from someone who read the books I didn’t like how vulgar the characters were presented. Henry Cavill’s Geralt acted like an anti hero when in the books and the game W3 he felt like a hero with a good heart. In the show he’s like Wolverine when he should be more like Batman. Yes Geralt is a person who doesn’t want to get involved in political affairs but he’s also a good person and will gladly help if need be. He just felt too angry and irritated in the show and not calm and collected like how I know him to be. I hate the scene when he punches Dandelion and pretty much his whole attitude towards him. Their friendship is something so beautiful in the books. He’s one of the few people Geralt can call a good friend and that’s who Dandelion is or at least supposed to be. Anya’s Yennefer was too raunchy imo. Yes in the books she is known for her sexuality but she never rapes a group of people with mind control/magic. Also she never struck me as Yen. Yen should be a mature looking and sounding woman and Anya just didn’t do it for me. She still felt like a kid. King Foltest and Queen Calanthe were supposed to be elegant and mighty yet in the show they’re again, pretty vulgar. She comes into the castle dirty after a battle and talks like she’s drunk. I mean in the Netflix show I guess it shows how different she is to Pavetta and Ciri but she shouldn’t be different.

idbsba,g280jsv,"I'm so gonna get downvoted for this.

Was kinda disappointed with the execution. Most of the issues I had was with the writing. So many writing choices were made for the show that ultimately fell flat (for me).

Looking back, the story was communicated well enough that it wasn't too confusing for new viewers. The main issue I had was that they chose to opt for a decade jumping gimmick, instead of telling a cohesive linear story. It wasn't confusing for me, since I had read the books beforehand. They chose not to incorporate the most important short story The Sword of Destiny, to accommodate the timeline jumps, and because of that >!the final moment when Geralt met Ciri felt flat and emotionless. I felt like they kinda missed the point with the whole destiny thing.!< There were some other things (Like Brokilon, or the portrayal of Dwarves and Elves), but this is the biggest one.

Acting was fine. There were definitely a few stand out stars that did splendid jobs with their roles, and there were performances that felt wooden, at times.

Stunt execution was good for the first few episodes, then it went downhill. (Especially with Rare Species). The portrayal of battle scenes were mostly inaccurate (tactically), and the scenes were not communicated well, at least for me.

Choosing to show the Battle of Sodden was *bold,* but then again the execution could've been better.

Moving on to Season 2, I am really interested in how some characters and their arcs are gonna be handled (looking at Cahir and Fringilla). It's interesting to see that they are gonna incorporate new elements exclusively from the writers which were not in the books. Hope they don't butcher it that bad.

Overall, it wasn't a bad show, but it wasn't the greatest thing ever.

- I do not like how Yennefer was adapted for the show (no idea where they got the teenage victim trope, but certainly not from the books) and I do not like the Geralt/Yennefer relationship, which to me both of these things make the Witcher.

- I didn’t see the friendship between Geralt and Jaskier I was expecting.

- They seriously messed up on the meeting of Geralt and Ciri

- The Last Wish adaptation was awful. Seriously. Yennefer mindraping 40+ people? A meaningless fuck at the end? Not hearing the wish? No Yen? Ugh

- I wanted Vilgefortz to be the hero of Sodden

- Fringilla the crazed cultist? Huh? 

**Things I truly did enjoy**

- Renfri, really loved her actor and was impressed with her scenes. Also Geralt/Renfri had great chemistry, and Renfri has a far better musical score

174bzck,k4l2nay,"Incidentaly, because the name does come from the books, it is much better explained in them. 

Not directly but much better set up. 

You see, book Ciri is a book worm (sorry for using book a lot). She knows her history. She also reads about all kinds of other stuff. Including about monsters at Kaer Morhen. 

But really, she spends several months with Yen in the books where it is said they like to lie down or sit down and read books. 

So this explains why and how Ciri would know everyhting about Falka. Falka is an historical figure in the Witcher World. She has been kind of the one figure who personifies vengeance. This because she is someone who unleashed a brutal civil war after being slited in some royal succession shenanigans. Falka was sidelined in not a pleasant way and she came back with a vengeance. She lit up the country, rallying the people around her and firing them up to war / vengeance / killing / brutality. 

So what this name and this person translates in the books is pure and simply: Cold Blood Vengeance, or in other words, ""at my signal, unleash hell""

When you get to the point where Ciri decides to get this name, you already have a big hint that she has decided to become fine with killing. She has crossed the bridge of innocence. She is now ready to kill for whatever reason, without second thoughts. 

In the book this happens differently because Ciri is younger. And she has been way more sheltered up to this point. She did not solo big monsters in the books. She did not fist fight big guys. In fact, the very first time she killed was just before adopting the Falka name. 

It was her reaction to being left alone in some unknown place (book Ciri has no idea where she is). She thinks Geralt + Yen are either dead or abandoned her. So, in her mind, there is nothing else. The world is all terrible, it´s all death and destruction. She knows how to fight, she knows how to kill.....so.....that´s it. For the time being, she is coping with that becoming her reality. 

There are more details in the books. Like...she gets abused into an unwanted sexual relationship. So...you can clearly understand why a young girl who has had all that happen to her...would turn dark side big time. 

I do not understand exactly what the series wants to do. 

Because it looks like the series is going to ""romanticize"" Ciri killing or doing other bad stuff. When it was not supposed to be ""romanticized"". It was supposed to be seen as a period where Ciri goes deep into the dark side.

rxuvla,hrkzjaa,"I agree with some of his points. They could have made the environments more colourful and given them more of a regional identity. If you put the shows Oxenfurt and the one from the games next to eachother, then I definetly prefer the CDPR design and when we first see Yennefer and Cahir stumble around it, it's hard to actually pinpoint that it's that city that they're in. They could have toned down the shilling for Yennefer by other characters a little, but all in all I don't mind her story-arc and thought that it was well done and set up stuff for her to do in the future. Contrary to him, I do like Jaskier and since he's a similar kind of ""troubadour that constantly gets himself into trouble, by proxy of his penis or flapping mouth"" in the books, there isn't really much they could do about that part of his characterisation, without making him to different a character. I can see though how people might find him kind of grating and that scene where he has that spat with the harbour-guard was just unnecessary and very cringy in my opinion. It is fitting for Jaskier to get himself into trouble, because he couldn't keep his mouth shut, but since it wasn't Jaskier who paid the price for that, but that elf guy who got killed over it, there wasn't much comedy to be found in it for me. That almost proxy-rant at the audience by the showrunners was just the cherry on top of a scene I could have really done without.

The Drinker guy does make those kind of edgy jokes about ""strong female/diverse characters"", that some people might find offputting, but just for those who haven't watched his videos: It's a running joke for the guy. I'm not saying everyone has to find it funny, but it's not actually malicious.
