I agree that most of the other fantasy shows are either worse or at the same level with the exception of House of Dragon clearly being above everything in a league of it's own.

154mimo,jsqkkd6,"I enjoyed Season 1. 

Season 2 left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Went into season 3 with an open mind, but I feel like it’s struggling to play catch up to get everything where it needs to be in terms of relationships, characters, locations, etc because just season 2 skipped all of that for whatever was that plot. 

I’m fine with adapting and changing as needed, but overall everything feels sloppily executed. 

A lot of the dialogue feels lazy. Fuck is one of my favorite words and I use it way more than I should, but the show beats me by a lot. 

It feels like a big misunderstanding of what the story is supposed to be, by that I mean the twisting of fairy tails and tropes to be different.

I can hardly tell one location to the next, everything feels/looks pretty generic other than the wide shots of Thanedd. I’ll praise game of thrones for each region looking and feeling different, not just the location but the people too. 

Cavill’s departure looms over, his geralt feels like the most interesting/ best part of the show but he hardly gets screen time. 

I also didn’t really like Time of Contempt as compared to the others, going into Baptism of Fire and it was instantly better.",8,2023-07-20 22:08:49,518.1469444444444,enjoyed season season left bad taste mouth went season open mind feel like struggling play catch get everything needs terms relationships characters locations etc season skipped whatever plot im fine adapting changing needed overall everything feels sloppily executed lot dialogue feels lazy fuck one favorite words use way show beats lot feels like big misunderstanding story supposed mean twisting fairy tails tropes different hardly tell one location next everything feelslooks pretty generic wide shots thanedd ill praise game thrones region looking feeling different location people cavills departure looms geralt feels like interesting best part show hardly gets screen time also didnt really like time contempt compared others going baptism fire instantly better

154mimo,jsvyz37,"This might be the most delusional take I have ever read here.

I don't even need to explain the obvious about how bad the writing is and how it focuses on all the wrong things. If you disagree, then by all means I'll let the reviews and time speak for itself. Vol 2 can't save the damage that has already been done to the tv show.

Like it if you want, but to claim that a show that has been overall subpar so far is according to you ranked among the best fantasy shows...it says more about the thirst for high fantasy genre than anything else. Ever thought of that?For what it is, right now, it is forgettable.

The books are also inferior to the videogame. Not only inferior, but much less popular. So as a result, the work that popularized the franchise by following the adventures of Geralt, is right now focusing on the thing that people cared less about: royal political intrigue. It was interesting in the videogame, but it was never the main focus. It was all about the emotional encounters. The multiple side quest stories about what defines a monster. This what made people fall in love with The Witcher.

Not the books. Not the mutilated version that is this tv show that adapts neither.

There is no protagonist so far, that's how bad this is when all people want is Geralt. Instead we get to watch a bunch of characters that add nothing because production thought they could pull a GoT out of this.

And now here we are, ofc someone had to go against the flow of criticism to paint a better picture of obvious mediocrity.

It doesn't have a lot of action and is very slow paced but I found the inter character dynamics very interesting and would take that over meaningless action or overblown drama every time.

I agree that it's perhaps not fair to compare the actors directly because HotD had much better material for them to work with and better directing so it's not the actors fault but the resulting performances are better in HotD.

14nnlm0,jqne658,"Throwing my hat in the ring. My fiancé and watched season one and two and enjoyed them and even watched the spin off season and liked it as well. She is not a video gamer and knew nothing about the series but is a sci-fi and fantasy fan. I’m a long time video gamer (40 yrs) and played  similar titles but not the Witcher itself. I don’t think that really matters though in the review of this season because this the most boring overwritten garbage I’ve seen besides really bad overdramatized Japanese or korean live action fantasy series. 

Her and I each watched ep1 separately and abandoned the series early in ep2 separately and both shared the same opinion of how bad and boring this season is even though we watched it separately.. 

 After desperately holding on all the way through episode one hoping episode two would get better,  I could barely get through the first 10 minutes of the second episode before I finally decided to turn it off and rant here! Lol ;) And it’s not that I don’t like good complex  dialogues or complicated premises or storylines, I do.. And, I liked the first and second seasons and both at first had complicated  time lines from different character paths. Its that I don’t like the same old emotional clichés  droned on and on and on to the point it’s ridiculous. 

We get it he loves her she loves him they’re afraid to do anything about it. We got it in the first three minutes!! We got it in the first two seasons, got it, move on! It’s not creating greater depth and complexity to keep going on and on and on about the same damn thing. It just makes it longer and more boring. Sprinkle it here and there sure. Bring it up at key moments sure. But an entire episode just going on and on and on about it. Its like the story is so thin they had nothing really to write about so they keep going on and on about the same thing. Flipping repetitive garbage… boring.

So, while watching ep 2, It dawned on me, they must be using the actual video game or book dialogue which is exactly why it’s so bad. There are no dynamics  to the dialogues or performances, its the same monotone overly forlorn or gooey monologues in the same flat tone over and over again. It’s like they’re trying to shoot ultra but it just comes out droll. Bad writing and bag directing coaching good actors to perform bad. 

 People arguing that because lines came from the actual books it makes it better,  It doesn’t matter if it came from the Books or the games either way its dreadful dialogue writing. Boring drawn out over and over. Trying to mimic the video game too much can be a disaster. This is a series.  I don’t play video games to watch  the cut scenes and want to watch all the bad dialogue from bad writers in video games. Let’s face it video game dialogue is not the best in the world. 

They should’ve gotten better tv and movie writters and focused on more action and better flow  instead of these long drawn out super boring conversations. Its a fine line if you make it too much a new series well then you piss off the fans cause it’s nothing like the books or games if you make it too much like the games or books well then its just bad writing and boring and the average people hate it. I don’t blame Cavill for leaving in my opinion he did the right thing. This season three is garbage.

14nnlm0,jtutqx7,"(Before I start, I haven't played the Witcher games, I haven't read the books though I intend on buying them soon. I am also on episode 6, but was accidentally spoilt on the rest of season.) 

My greatest frustration with the season is the fact that I don't understand the characters anymore, and plots were hinted and dropped. The main 3 - Geralt, Yen, Ciri - have remained similar to previous seasons. Protect the child, simple. They could emphasise this less tbh. They don't need to repeat what we know.

I'm neutral towards Jaskier. I don't care for his sexual orientation, it doesn't change the core of his character. I just wish he had a greater impact on the plot of the season.

Just, what the hell is up with Fringilla. I dont understand why she would ally with the elves.

Speaking of the elves, for someone so old, Franscesca is such a child. When you choose to fight, there will always be losses on either side. You lost your husband, it's horrible, but those are the consequences of war.

Cahir and Stregobor (is it Stregobor? Or is it Dijistra? I get them mixed up for some reason) seem to flipflop as it pleases them. I understood them rudimentally during season 2, but the final decisions of them threw me off. Stregobor more so. The man values power, why conjure flame magic??? 

As for Cahir, If there was more time devoted to Cahirs debating on his place in the Flames plans, perhaps when talking to another, there was a slight tremble, a small glimmer of hesitation. Just something to hint at an internal struggle. 

Other chars seem wasted in this season much like Jaskier. Thrown away. Rience seemed like a formidable foe, yet was disposed of with ease? And when at Geralt mercy st the beginning, he wasn't killed? If he was such a threat, i would have offed him immediately. Tissaia was so despondent at the betrayal of her lover, but before she was a castle of her own. Maybe it's a metaphor. As Aretuza falls, so does her lady. But what her lover whose name I can't spell, imo, wasn't enough to shatter her foundations.

The last season teased the Wild Hunt, something I know just enough about (ie, a small google) to be really excited and intrigued for. But there was only, what, 2 scenes with them? Not even at the beginning of the season, of the Trio trying to research the Hunt. Ik the key to getting them away is with Ciri so the focus on training her is understandable. But they seem to rely on what Ciri could do instead of using their own agency to do what they want to begin with. Everyone wants to steal the girl. No-one wants to earn her trust. You can do that for the wrong reasons.

It's just so many little things that have coalesced into sheer disappointment.

And there is an argument to be had that confusion is part of the charm, or what was intended to encourage more viewership. For me, there is a fine line between curiosity and confusion. Curiosity has me have most of the jigsaw pieces and I'm doggedly chasing after the last ones to make this mess into a picture. That I enjoy. Confusion is me trying to make sense from a box full of pieces from different puzzles, where you find out that end that there are still pieces missing.

14nnlm0,jq91o6n,"this season sucks. I was forcing myself to finish this first part. THE BIGGEST flop in this show and so many others these days is they ARE UNABLE to create likable characters on the screen and this is a result and a combination of a director, writers and actor input. Geralt is the only one. everyone else is just awful and they can die off imho.

the second biggest FLOP is dialogs. so, so awful. I was about to turn of the tv when Jaskier responded to Radovid saying ""im scared"" with ""Just saying that makes you braver than you know"". is this Brazilian telenovela?

Ciri is a spoiled princess, no one likes that. the fact that she can kill the monster but then have to be babysit lacks logic? Yen speech was so uncharismatic and clearly actress is simply not good at that kind of stuff. Jaskier is suddenly Bi and looks so unattractive but he suppose to be a don juan.

episode 5 was so badly put together. Editing, directing was a joke, this kind of mick when they show the same event again but show what really happened was done plenty of times and they couldnt do it well. it was like rewatching the same thing with longer scenes. you can do it way clever and it was done way way better in many movies and series.

overall i come from playing the games NOT books and what I wanted to see is Geralt of Rivia. his adventures. monster hunting. this have nothing to do with that. he is in fact a side character and I dont think he is even in top3 screentime actors. probably not even top10 if it comes to lines read. ridiculous.",0,2023-07-01 19:09:43,59.161944444444444,season sucks forcing finish first part biggest flop show many others days unable create likable characters screen result combination director writers actor input geralt one everyone else awful die imho second biggest flop dialogs awful turn tv jaskier responded radovid saying im scared saying makes braver know brazilian telenovela ciri spoiled princess one likes fact kill monster babysit lacks logic yen speech uncharismatic clearly actress simply good kind stuff jaskier suddenly bi looks unattractive suppose juan episode badly put together editing directing joke kind mick show event show really happened done plenty times couldnt well like rewatching thing longer scenes way clever done way way better many movies series overall come playing games books wanted see geralt rivia adventures monster hunting nothing fact side character dont think even top screentime actors probably even top comes lines read ridiculous

14nnlm0,jqxqsfd,"Phew…. I read the books like 20 years ago and enjoyed them.
Played the game and enjoyed it.
But season 3, watching it with my wife, is a slog!

First of all, Ciri: The actress is to old. I‘m sorry even if the actress were 14 in real life, no one would ask for ID if she bought liquor. She just seems too old and mature to be acting the way she is: She just blurts out „that‘s no basilik!“ like a toddler proving his parents wrong. It‘s uncharacteristic!
So the actress just doesn’t fit the character.

Then timing: Season 2 ends, Ep1 S3 and after 10 minutes Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri are a happy family…. After what, 2 days? Everything is forgotten? 
The producers and writers are not able to portray passing of time in any way shape or form. Ciri calls for Geralt and even though they split up and are hundreds of miles apart, he is right there, in the next scene, when the wild hunt comes - AND THE EMBRACE AT THE END? Oh my god who directed and cut that scene?

Go look at it, you just know, that these people were just standing there, 6 feet apart waiting for someone to shout „action“ and not a daughter and her father surviving a horrible situation! Even the way they walk towards each other! They leisurely stroll, even my 3 year old runs to me faster than these two.

Or Geralt not killing Rience in EP1…. Why?! 

And the witches…. They gained might and power, became infertile but they use that power to become more beautiful than anyone can imagine… That‘s the whole premise of the witches in this universe: They are so powerful that they can turn themselves into women that every king desires, they don’t need magic to influence kings and ruin kingdoms. I know it‘s an old trope but it‘s one that people love! Even now we talk about the princess Helen, who was so pretty that her abduction launched a thousand ships (or something like that) and is the basis for the whole story surrounding Troy.

Well these witches are hags! Huge noses, chins, narrow eyes - there is no magic in that!! If I wanna see ordinary people I just look out the window! When I watch a FANTASY show, I wanna be transported away from this world.

If you enjoy it, continue, it’s your joy and no one should take that away… but this show will sadly be axed sooner than later and it‘s sad to see such wasted potential.

14nnlm0,jrily81,"Really did NOT enjoy it. I completely get why Cavill bowed out.

Robbie Amell’s god awful attempt of sounding anything but American (yes he’s born Canadian, but I could only hear the American from growing up in the hollywood scene) it was so SO misplaced for me with a poor fake accent, I had to skip it each time. Look at Peter Dinklage. An American in a predominantly UK/European cast setting. Yet as ludicrously posh as he made his accent; it worked! We accepted it and it was fantastic. I felt Gallatin’s character was unnecessary, and if they wanted the character a part of it- pick someone who can do that accent or similar. Not someone who sounded & reminded me of Batman when he does his harsh whisper-talking.

-Yen and Geralt basically giving eachother notes instead of talking, I thought e1 was taken from the Notebook film itself. 

- The sex scenes. I actually think the last episode had 4 sex scenes in maybe more? Sex scenes are lazy writing. I’m not asking for an opinion on that. They just are. 

-E4 being set in ballroom with no Ciri, and recurring dream sequences and older scenes. Whoever has been in charge of writing the Witcher for Netflix needs firing. It’s not a cliffhanger if I wanna chuck myself off it from boredom. 

- The beheaded queen, why was it such campy humour? Felt like I was watching a pantomime. 

- Gavin McTavish was a shining star in this for me. He did the best with what he was given. 

-The casts makeup was bizarre. Ciri having a caked layer of foundation and contour every scene is ridiculous. The makeup artist BTS is clearly a poor one. Anya’s (Yen) skin had yellow tones because whoever did her makeup did a terrible job of it. 

-Whoever did the wardrobe. Why was Yen stood in s3 e1 with that clearly H&M belt on and pencil skirt. Could they not have at least made an effort to create a garment, or use something that doesn’t say “2006”. Same with Ciri’s hair. The wig was awful and worse kept.

-jaskier being bi didn’t bother me. I don’t know if it’s true to the books; but I could see that tbf.

-At times it felt like a musical. So many scenes of singing and drinking with some of it not from bards. When the bards DID sing on the boat, I honestly felt Ciri was about to burst into song, and me, tears.

- The humour this season… where is it? The witty remarks that were clever In s1? The “jokes” this season were stale and not close to funny. It’s just insulting intelligence at this point, and you all wonder why Henry wants nothing to do with this pile of hot turds?

-Speaking of Monster hunting. Where were they? You get a brief glimpse before Ciri goes all Charlie’s Angels Editing on the boat monster. Cringey and I didn’t like it. Also Geralt would’ve and has been faster to protect her. She lay on the deck of the boat and accepted death. I mean…ok.


-The Hunt edit. The green screens when she’s being chased by the hunt and when they’re on the boat is laughable- and NOT in a good way. Also Geralt rocking up out of thin air bc plot demands it. 

-At the end of s4, part 1 we see XYZ is a villain. But who cares at this point? It was flat flat flat. And the shame of it is; GOOD writers, GOOD directors hiring other good BTS people in editing, makeup, hair, clothes, lines- god all of it- would’ve made this show fantastic and Henry would’ve never left nor needed to. For me it had the *potential* to be a GoT 2.0. The people in charge threw that away. 

Who is defending these show’s writers and their “creative choices” anymore? When the lead actor tells you it’s a shit show and leaves, course it’s gonna be just that. 

I love the Witcher games, concept and world. Which is why I critique it hard- because simply, I’m disappointed.

14nnlm0,jrw13vs,"Episode 3 is when I realized I was really bored - and it seemed like Geralt wasn't doing anything - or saying much, either.

Reminded me of GoT S3 or S4, when all the ""major"" characters had been killed, and so everything was about the ""B-Team"" wandering the world aimlessly and stumbling around. At that point, I dropped all interest in the story and only watched for the sex and monsters.

But The Witcher S3 hardly has any monsters.  ....and I really don't want to see what any of these people are doing in the middle of the night, or the woods, or whatever...

The BIG REVEAL to me in Episode 3 is that there were so many scenes of people just talking - and the camera jumped back and forth between focus on the one on the left, then the one on the right, then the one of the left, etc.   Then I noticed the weird bland lighting - and realized they were filming on the cheap by using a big digital screen like in The Mandalorian - placing the actors in front of it to film the conversations.  So...no movement, no props, no showing of legs and the studio floor.  - UGH - !!  And this went on and on in Eps 3 & 4.  People in this thread have called them the ""greenscreen"" scenes - like Ciri on the prop horse ... ugh.

The tech is not at fault here - the fault is using it too much and not having the actors move around a bit and use physical props in their dialogue - put them IN THE SCENE instead of just in front of a pretty wall.

You come across as one of the most confusing posters here on this subreddit.

Because you often have good insights into the books and you sometimes say stuff on point.

But then suddenly you start pulling BS on the books for whatever random reason.

Book Yennefer was never a bitch towards Ciri. NEVER!!!!!!

If you would like to really stretch it you could talk about their very first interaction where Yen is more forceful towards Ciri.

But please, do not forget the context of said interaction lol

Yen did not know Ciri at all then. Ciri was very much scared and feeling like she wanted to run away on the spot. And Yen could read those thoughts and was quite like ""what can I do about it?"". And Yen being Yen, she decided to be in your face and confront Ciri head on at first. Which....it did work in the end. You might think she could have been more sweet but no idea if Ciri would have believed it.

As example, Triss was also quite bossy towards Ciri at KM. And I have not seen you complaining about it ever.

The thing is....Ciri was a child. And sometimes you have to tell children what to do. Its not a democratic process with children and it should not be.

You know, on a personal level I truly believe you know the books well enough.

For that fact, it should have been more faithful to the source material and people should care about the source material.

Did you even you even think that through before you typed it or is that something you jab at everybody as your hard insight diss? Who’s ignorant?!?!? LMAO! Only ignorant one here is you you’re ignorant to your own prejudice towards somebody you’ve never met just because they don’t like the same thing you do and you wanna pretend like you know me but you’re completely factually wrong in everything you said about me lol. Do you just make up things that you “think” you know to make you sound good and think they make you sound smarter? I think you do and that would make you the elitist L O L check, fail. What are you a fragile youth pointing your finger at everybody else and pretending to be enlightened while you judge people you don’t even know and make completely wrong assumptions about? Check mark, yes!  What strange? Just because I didn’t play it didn’t mean I didn’t see the advertisements or watch the game reviews on it. Which I did. But there you go assuming you know something without really thinking about it. There’s nothing strange about it. I saw the game duh. You don’t have to play the game to watch Playthru’s of the game or trailers and assess good or bad graphics now do you? But there you go assuming Because I didn’t play it I must not have seen it.  At the tim, I saw screenshots, trailers , youtube reviews even steam trailers of the game and from what I saw it looked like a really older engine with little to no tessellation (look it up) and bad anti aliasing compared to games of the time. WHAOR had way better graphics even before that time. The graphics Witcher had were terrible compared to other games In fact they looked like a an older engine graphics compared to better games around that time like skyrim IMO. Also The Witcher wasn’t even in this decade lmao!  I asked my son-in-law (26) last night if he ever played the Witcher and he said he tried to but it wasn’t that good so he didn’t play it long.

Lmao what did you take one class of psych 101 and now you think your God? You should’ve looked up narcissism. Spoiler you exhibit it. Also, I wrote I don’t like it because it’s long and boring.

What did you hear that taunt in WOW chat? I think you’re a an arrogant college kid that’s probably  in college because elitist daddy wants him to be but he could care less and who thinks he knows everything and wants to judge people Falsely on his own limited intellect and not facts. FACT:  I was just up late last night till 4 AM playing Diablo 4 world tier 3. I think the last three games I’ve played were pathfinder kingmaker, Warhammer Martyr, and Divinity Original Sin. I think at least one is in this decade and another wrong assumption by you being put down. You should sit in the chair look in the mirror and ask yourself what do you really KNOW versus what you think you know? I bet it’s very little. Do you enjoy being wrong?

They are all behaving as it is in the originals, I didn't even mind that Tress was darker than she should be, but its okay, the actor made her likeable and is true to her.   


But now comes the season 3 where they have started to stray a lot needlessly. Like Geralt going into some random castle to find Therya or whatever her name is, that never happened anywhere. We can agree that some changes can happen in the tv show yada yada and okay, put that in, but it is not even relevant anymore. They are chasing the big bad mage because he is after ciri and doing other shits, not because of one girl and a failed experiment. Now the definition of Jaskier is... whoremonger. Every women that is around him, must be flirted with and laid. Keyword being women... they made him bisexual which was never a case nor will it ever be. Which means they put in freaking politics where it shouldnt be... and no less with Radovad who is supposed to be Vizimir's 12 year old son, not his adult brother. The definition of Radovad?

14nnlm0,jrk3i5z,"My assumed friend your points make sense.
You are undoubtedly more mature,intellectual and experienced than us.
But i have to clarify that the game you are referring to is most probably witcher 2 or 1 not 3 in my opinion because if you would have played witcher 3 rather than trailers, reviews and other stuff you would have understood better. I know Witcher 1 is not much great in these areas, 2 is great 👍, but Witcher 3 is absolute gem 💎 its execution from gameplay,mechanics,graphics and creativity is flawless ( dialogues i admit are not a strong area in gaming but they were good enough to keep to in anticipation and hype throughout story ,no matter if its side quest or main mission and sometimes i craved for dialogues and interactions specifically related to complex story build between main characters including ciri, geralt.yenn and tress and voice acting of geralt was Great 👍)
You stated things in harsh manner based only on trailer and side content without actually experiencing the execution of witcher 3 specifically .
I was quite bored by playing games at that point as started from gta 3 era around 2000s and it was most memorable ride in long time and i was not able to distance myself from the computer and game until the game was finished including 2 beautifully executed dlc for witcher 3.
I haven't been able to immersive myself like that from that poiny on i have played modern titles like god of war 2018 ( graphically acclaimed at that point).
Respectfully other person was spouting insane bullshit i understand but rather you criticized a game which is close to our hearts so i was rather sad. My Main point is based on Witcher 3 and dlc's.
I will still say play Witcher 3.
Play it considering gaming industry was not able to deliver a more finer product than Witcher 3 ( excluding some like rdr 2 ,..)

14nnlm0,jrki7i8,"HI thank you for the platitudes, but I must start off with a correction.

**I didn't ""start"" anything just stated that I didn't play the Witcher games in my OP about the Wither SEASON 3 series. It was at that point ""Runesrcape"" came in talking trash that basically I shouldn't have an opinion because I didn't play the games. Which is incredibly stupid because my comment and, in fact this entire Reddit page, is about the Netflix Witcher series 3 not the game.**  But, to provide more detail, I replied I didn't play the Witcher because I thought the graphics were ""dog shit"" at the time which they very well could have been. Mostly I was just matching the sharpness I was given by Runescrape.

At any rate, no one bothered to ask but, I have checked on all 3 games within the past year several times because I thought about buying them when season 2 released and in October through December 2022 on Steam sales. Thought maybe my Fiancé and I would play them together but If I was going to buy Witcher 3 I'd want to buy 1,2 and any expansion as well. That's just how I am and wouldn't want to buy at the end of the game series only to want to go back and buy the first 2 so I looked for a sale on all 3. In the end, I still thought the graphics engine was not for me and wasn't willing to invest in the games also because mainly they were older and 3 was still costly. Is that crime I didn't want to buy/play them? Do the gamers of the world need to flock to this page and hate? Apparently so in the beginning.

Final thoughts. That's great that you and dogshit Runescrape and anyone else thinks it is a good game, good for you, I'm not trying to convince you otherwise so why try to convince me just because I state a contrary opinion? If you feel you need to defend your position just because I stated, my opinion well then good for you but it won't change my opinion I promise you. I know, I've tried to change it myself 3 times but just won't budge!  So just, go play it and be happy and I still think the graphics were dog shit but that's my opinion. Not every experience, opinion or Idea needs to be a shared one.

Thanks for at least keeping it respectful. And to be honest I didn't read past the middle because I feel it's irrelevant to me at this point.  I'm glad you like it, but I won't give it another chance. I've tried at least 3 times in the past to consider it, it's not for me and paying for a game that old is just not what I'm going to do at this point...

I love and know who I am, and you don't' have to think like me but your facts are incorrect about bisexuality or sexual diverse lifestyles not having political agendas in today's culture. A lot of different groups have political agendas, its natural in a nation built on politics lol. It is not like politics is a poison fruit, just know how to digest it.

My second point in my second post was this. Originally, I was replying to your comment ""How is being bisexual delving into politics?"" and to you directly about that comment and it seemed like your reply didn't rebut what I said in my comment but instead deflected to other comments from other people or OP.  You went off about woke stuff and religion, not the bisexuality being political that's why I said, ""stay focused"". You didn't deny or defend your original statement about bisexuality and politics instead off shot into something else, guess you didn't have a good response on same bisexual/political statement. And now you're just getting defensive. Those who can't logically defend their statements in a debate with facts change the subject or cuss. Facts: diverse lifestyles are highly politicized in today's social climate, and MOST CHOOSE TO BE for support and influence within social and political spheres, that's just a pure fact I now see you're painfully ignorant to and refuting poorly.

In fact, now it just seems like you're dropping into baseless boyhood slander to defend your position you couldn't defend in the first place and just had to change topic to wokeism, religion etc etc.. pointing your finger at other's is what you do best I imagine.  You know sexual diversity is highly politicized, but yet nowhere did you want to admit it. You didn't have a good answer, so you just switched gears to someone else's comments. How about you stand up to YOUR COMMENTS! and stop the slandering. You have a lot of growing up to do.

Ps. both my cousin and my Fiancé's brother were gay and both died of AIDS, you're not speaking to a ""basement dweller"" but that's just the kind of assumptive, baseless, shit talking slander people get when trying to reasonably talk to ""people"" like you that get easily offended when their viewpoint or own BS is questioned or proven illogical but they are so convinced they're right but so afraid to hear the facts that refute it and just slip into defensive slander.

14pbiwg,jrz1xwm,"Here are my feelings. When I first learned that Henry Cavill would be playing Geralt I immediately had my doubts as a person who has played the games and  read the books. I felt he would come off as too young and a pretty boy. Far from the Witcher I know. But I was very surprised and happy to see him play Geralt. He got the character well and it's obvious he put the time and effort into it and cared about the character and art that is the witcher.

My fear now is I just don't see Liam Helmsworth as a viable replacement. I think they are close to the same age in real life but Liam feels younger and even more of a pretty boy. I think they chose him because they wanted someone well known. Also, now that Henry Cavill is not there they will do whatever they want with the story, losing it if not completely then it turns into a sliced up piece of poo. I will not watch it if it goes completely off the rails and hate it when Hollywood does this. They are doing it with the Mayfair Witches right now on AMC. If it really does go that way I see maybe 1 season with Liam as the Witcher before it's just gone.

14pbiwg,jqq1yaj,"This is something I've always firmly believed since reading Blood of Elves. Not a lot really happens in that book, especially anything action packed for your traditional blockbuster. The book really takes its time with the story and it's really easy to tell that this would be extremely difficult to work in your traditional TV show. I was always worried about how this would translate into season two and boy was I in for a surprise. I was even expecting the showrunners to take a similar approach as season one by combining two of the books to make it more condensed and palatable for mainstream audiences. This would especially make more sense considering the usual four to five season longevity of most Netflix series.

It is hard to see Netflix ever going for a multi film series considering streaming is a big television distributor and most original films only get sequels after performing well upon their release like Extraction. In addition to this there is the appeal of this format considering the conclusion of the massively popular Game of Thrones series. 

But by using the film format this fixes a lot of problems the show faced: introducing characters early, more and longer subplots to fill seasons, creating original characters and storylines, less focused storytelling. I could easily see each of the books being translated effectively into 90 minute to 2 hour films with more compelling and focused plots and less emphasis on side characters until they are important to the story. Admittedly, the short story collections wouldn't really work in film format but the film adaptations could easily insert the necessary ones as flashbacks and context for the plot. But alas, here we are with muddled seasons containing useless and uninteresting filler because Netflix is trying to capitalize on the source material and the trends of the industry.",1,2023-07-05 12:31:09,148.51916666666668,something ive always firmly believed since reading blood elves lot really happens book especially anything action packed traditional blockbuster book really takes time story really easy tell would extremely difficult work traditional tv show always worried would translate season two boy surprise even expecting showrunners take similar approach season one combining two books make condensed palatable mainstream audiences would especially make sense considering usual four five season longevity netflix series hard see netflix ever going multi film series considering streaming big television distributor original films get sequels performing well upon release like extraction addition appeal format considering conclusion massively popular game thrones series using film format fixes lot problems show faced introducing characters early longer subplots fill seasons creating original characters storylines less focused storytelling could easily see books translated effectively minute hour films compelling focused plots less emphasis side characters important story admittedly short story collections wouldnt really work film format film adaptations could easily insert necessary ones flashbacks context plot alas muddled seasons containing useless uninteresting filler netflix trying capitalize source material trends industry

I mean, Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri *did* travel together for months, it was just in Ebbing, and after Stygga Castle. But yes, it wasn’t enough and Sapko never extrapolated on it. 

> Apparently show Yennefer does not care (about inviting Triss over her) about that but book Yen sure did.

You’re absolutely correct that book Yen was pissed and gave us the amazing Dear Friend response, but of course Geralt in the show thought Yennefer dead at this point so it wouldn’t make sense for him to ask her…

> Ciri and the bard did witness Geralt + Yennefer´s reunion. Which was really their important reunion after a couple years apart in the books. Jaskier did some narration. The dialogues were different and more serious in the books.

Some of the dialogue here is literally verbatim from ToC. No unicorn joke of course, but that’s an Easter egg to game fans more than anything because the unicorn was a throwaway comment in the books.  I actually really liked that scene. 

For the rest, yeah I agree, that’s how it happened in the books. Yet no offense, but why does it matter? You know the vast majority of these things can’t happen based on S1 and S2. 

Yennefer can’t simply go to Aretuza without supplication because she’s a traitor. Geralt isn’t going to send Ciri to her because she initially wanted to kill her in S2 and he doesn’t trust her. All the other mages have more

Being practical,

I think Cavill was having issues with producers all the way from Season 1. But he would have been willing to go on because he loves portraying the Witcher.

However, after Season 2 performed worse vs Season 1, likely Netflix wanted to cut some budget. And that started to generate very high admin pressure to get rid of expensive stuff. Which...unfortunately Cavill was most likely quite expensive compared to all other cast.

Things just then escalate.....its corporate business. Management starts to piss you as much as they can. And eventually everyone gets mad at everyone and it will reach the point of no return.

This also explains why they replaced him by discount Hemsworth. Its pretty obvious they want to cut costs.

Now, Cavill was likely easy to piss due to him being overall disappointed with the series. So I think it did not really take that much to make him leave.

The rumours that they started to leak out that he was going around correcting everyone and was a nerd.....that kind of stuff was intended to piss him.

I can imagine also contract renewal meetings getting very shady with people all mad at each other. Producers maybe wanting to cut his pay and Henry not very happy about it.

You seem not to understand this but Ciri´s character at this point in the story is way more innocent. She is also younger but that´s not the real issue.

The real issue is that she would not be ready to face any grown up monster at this point in the story. From a mental perspective. She was not ready to kill people either this early in the story.

Changing this does change her overall character arc. It ruins what was her progression in the books. And it kind of turns her into a character that cant further progress anymore. Which is a narrative issue that the series is going to have and is already experiencing some complains about it.

It also changes the dynamics between her and Geralt.

In which book Geralt was way more careful / protective towards her. And this also changes Geralt´s character.

This would be akin to having the hobbits fighting the ring wraiths alone in Fellowship of the Ring and not having Aragorn save them.

14p3id9,jqijmir,"The way they traveled in Ebbing was definitely similar (moving on horseback from place to place and not staying long). It was for a shorter time though. They show implies close to a year I think, ebbing was for a few months. And honestly, I’m glad they added more time here. It was too short in the books, Sapko obviously was at the point where he just wanted to end it as all of LOTL ending was rushed, and in the show they were more damaged and needed to heal. 

S3 is more faithful to the books than the other seasons. That’s just a fact. It’s more faithful to the themes of found family and those relationships, to Yennefer’s book character and her motives, petty sorceresses hatching plots, etc.

Faithful doesn’t have to mean exact replica. LOTR movies are not an exact replica to the books and I still love them. The problem comes when base characters are changed completely. S2 was exceptionally bad with this, and while S1 was less I still had problems. S3 is more faithful than both. That doesn’t mean it’s perfect (it’s not, there are still glaring issues), it means it’s more faithful than before. 

To be quite frank, the dishonest people here are every single book fan who’s been with me saying they don’t want or expect an exact replica of the books and now demanding they do. It’s childish, petty, and embarrassing.

Also, side note,  I can’t understand why you’re wanting a love triangle between Geralt/Yennefer/Triss. First, that’s more a game thing, as you know in the books Triss never stood a chance over Yennefer. Triss was one regretted night, followed by years of obsession. It was the games that gave the rise to Team Triss, and to the idea that Geralt and Yennefer were only together because of a wish, and that was a major mistake. The show should have never mentioned that wish again, although at least in this season it’s basically implied the wish had nothing to do with their feelings.",10,2023-07-03 22:21:00,110.35,way traveled ebbing definitely similar moving horseback place place staying long shorter time though show implies close year think ebbing months honestly im glad added time short books sapko obviously point wanted end lotl ending rushed show damaged needed heal faithful books seasons thats fact faithful themes found family relationships yennefers book character motives petty sorceresses hatching plots etc faithful doesnt mean exact replica lotr movies exact replica books still love problem comes base characters changed completely exceptionally bad less still problems faithful doesnt mean perfect still glaring issues means faithful quite frank dishonest people every single book fan whos saying dont want expect exact replica books demanding childish petty embarrassing also side note cant understand youre wanting love triangle geraltyennefertriss first thats game thing know books triss never stood chance yennefer triss one regretted night followed years obsession games gave rise team triss idea geralt yennefer together wish major mistake show never mentioned wish although least season basically implied wish nothing feelings

You might or might not be aware that PR interviews are often somewhat staged. So someone might have green lighted or suggested such questions.

You do have interviews at events and stuff where you do not control as well which journalists will speak with whom. But there tends to be some sort of control.

Sometimes when some topics get out into the public its because someone already pissed someone internally and there has been a decision to let it go public. Usually this is something like ""lets address it first in a controlled way before we get hit big time by this info out of control""

They are not book accurate. Not, if You call having a few names and places right to be enough to be book accurate. The characters still are far off in many aspects - and in those places happen different things. 

The thing with the ""dear friend""-letters is a slap in the face of every fan of the books. They totally butchered this - and they butchered it on purpose. 

Shaerrawedd is totally different in the book. In the book the elves attack for a totally different reason. Yen should not be there at all. Rience should not be there at all. Nor does the scene make much sense within the show. 

Belleteyn is totally different in the books. Ciri should not be there at all. Nor does it make sense within the story that they take her there, as they know she is hunted and should hide.

14qw591,jqsaqpj,"I looked for your other post. I think you have good points; I am also used to bisexuals (especially men) being portrayed much worse so I can see why the kneejerk reaction is to dislike it w/ Jaskier. I respect it, just dislike it when one bisexual tries to say something is offensive to all of us. 

I think the difference with Jaskier has been the way specifically Joey has played him and how carefully he has approached it, which is very evident when he talks about it in interviews. While Jaskier has casual flings, he is also shown to have deeper relationships and suffered broken hearts when they don't work out. Saving this ""reveal"" for S3 was the best decision to me because he's already had a season out from S1 where, in his younger days, he basically was a slut, and now he's moved on, had his own very important plots, and been fully fleshed out. I just think combining all of that with him being bisexual skips over the idea of it simply following the stereotype, because Jaskier is many things, not ""just the bisexual.""

Didn't mean to diatribe, I just hope we can all find portrayals of ourselves or people like us that we truly enjoy in the end.",1,2023-07-06 01:07:28,161.12444444444444,looked post think good points also used bisexuals especially men portrayed much worse see kneejerk reaction dislike jaskier respect dislike one bisexual tries say something offensive us think difference jaskier way specifically joey played carefully approached evident talks interviews jaskier casual flings also shown deeper relationships suffered broken hearts dont work saving reveal best decision hes already season younger days basically slut hes moved important plots fully fleshed think combining bisexual skips idea simply following stereotype jaskier many things bisexual didnt mean diatribe hope find portrayals people like us truly enjoy end

My only real issues beyond that were Geralt not taking Firebro's head on the way back out through the portal -- and not even justifying it with needing him alive for interrogation or whatever-- and some of the ""travel times"" as people bounced around place to place feeling super iffy again. Even when they explicitly weren't portaling.

14mxna8,jq4cwd1,"Honestly as someone yet only familiar with the game, I did not enjoy it very much. Apart from a few moments it fails to capture my attention. The fights were cool, the relationships were okay, but it did not really stir anything up for me. I usually love book adaptations as they make me aware of books that I might be interested in reading, and I do want to read the books, but I feel the series, it lacks any gravitas. The only time I felt slightly emotional is when Geralt heared about Visena, but that whole scene relied on Henry’s acting skills and that is it.

No it is not horrible but I absolutely understand why the fans are upset. I also felt upset about the last two seasons of GoT as they obviously have no idea how to finish the story in a way that was meaningful and gave us a good taste in our mouth.

The best parallel for me would be the Outlander series. They do a great job adapting the books and they do steer away from the original but do it in a manner that respects the original, the whole series is amazing and I can connect to it and it stays with me forever. This show is very mediocre.

14mxna8,jq6z7m7,"Yep I agree, as a longtime Witcher game and book fan the showrunners really nailed the overall feel of the season. Our main characters are not only more true to their respective roots, but also there is added complexity that I feel the books didn't explore too much, like Jaskier's sadness and yearning to help the group and Ciri's eagerness to live up to her destiny.

Other positives I appreciated is the show's interpretation of some events that happen in the books, the improved CGI and writing, the branching storylines that all are interesting, and the show's willingness to focus more on political intrigue rather than all-out fighting.

The things I didn't like was the first episode's pacing, Djikstra and Phillipa's weird BDSM relationship, the character's pronunciation of Rience (it's Rye-awnce), and the little bits of clunkiness with the how the ball went (even though I really enjoyed the episode).

Yennefer is specifically playing at a political game in a (albeit misguided) attempt to frame Stregobor while doing what she thinks will unite the North against Nilfgaard. To do so she is playing all sides, as using any avenue she can to learn as much as possible. So the show portrays her doing that. 

As far as the layout, that was based partly on the books. While the Ball itself happened in real time, Geralt’s conversation with Vilgefortz was framed in the context of flashbacks, while Geralt and Yennefer talk inbetween making love all night, similar to the show.

14mxna8,jq6pyr6,"Bit unfair there.

Rita and Tissaia were actually more inviting to Ciri in the books once they were aware who she was.

And the reason why they were mad at her in the books was because she was using magic in town which was something they were supervising. Its like....if you park your car in a wrong place you cant complain the cops will come down on you. The problem was you parking the car wrong lol

Which is what happened with Ciri. She misbehaved, entered into a mess....felt the need to magically call for Yen´s help. And bang! She had been warned not to do anything that would make her noticeable in town. She did so! The cops came on her.

Then, yes, there was some confusion because both Tissaia and Rita thought she was a runaway student causing some mess in town. Which to them was someone in need of discipline. And for a moment Ciri also did not know how to present herself to them because she had no idea if she could trust them.

There.....this is the real book situation :)

You see...they were not just being cruel because cruelty. They had reasons.

And they were much nicer to Ciri once Yen showed up. They even invited Ciri for a hot bath at their private hotel SPA ;)

Rita also asked Yen if Ciri would like to attend Aretuza with a more advanced class instead of basics. And it was Yen that decided it would be good to have her start at the bottom. But you could see Rita was already wishing to help Ciri ;)

Also, there is nothing wrong about what you see Tissaia doing in the books. You only have a couple short scenes. You do see her covering up for Yen when questioned by Vilgefortz. She was the single one not questioning Yen + Geralt at all. You also have her not wanting anyone hurt or arrested at Thanedd. No idea why you would consider such a character to have a bad nature.

Yen, despite remaining more calm and collected, is the one who actually does not want to fight again if at all possible.

14trto6,jr5bksf,"I may be confusing later episodes with earlier episodes with this list (that's not in any order). And I will say, I actually think the earlier episodes of s3 are actually more trying to rush through some loose ends of s2 and harmonize them with what's coming in s3, so early s2 is less ""book accurate"" than, say, ep5. And while too much has changed at this point to get a completely accurate adaptation, I think it's fair to say that the story is much more recognizably ""from the books"" in s3 than s2 was, which started to lose all familiarity. Some of the familiar plot points are:

1.	Professor hired killer plot  
2.	Jaskier getting kicked out of a house  
3.	Codringer and Fenn  
4.	The Applegard (sp?) subplot

I don't think Geralt's ""whole storyline"" is about his abandonment issues and I don't think he'd want to a full reunion with her, and honestly she probably never did either.

159vsf3,jti9kmt,"Well.....

This is the result of a lot of things being messed up from the books. 

. book Geralt hated his mother for abandoning him. 

. It is hinted that she might have abandoned him because mages are scared about their possible offspring. Other mages might prefer her baby dead if they knew about him. 

. The entire fertility trade for magic does not exist in the books at all. It is said that at some point Tissaia did want to sterilize all magic users (not only female and not only her school). Its never confirmed in the books if she ever did anything anywhere near it. 

. the obvious conclusion is that book mages are indeed fertile when they are young. If not...there would be no need for Tissaia to be scared about it. 

. the logical consequence in the books is just that they stop being fertile in result of age and use of magic. Some of them might be naturally more resistant vs others. 

. there is nothing about Visenna´s death in the books. Geralt will never see her again after his big injury which was depicted in Season 1 and which did happen in the books. They did meet that time and that time only in the books. It was pretty clear that Geralt had major issues with her and she did not want to discuss any of it with him.",13,2023-07-26 18:00:22,658.0061111111111,well result lot things messed books book geralt hated mother abandoning hinted might abandoned mages scared possible offspring mages might prefer baby dead knew entire fertility trade magic exist books said point tissaia want sterilize magic users female school never confirmed books ever anything anywhere near obvious conclusion book mages indeed fertile young notthere would need tissaia scared logical consequence books stop fertile result age use magic might naturally resistant vs others nothing visennas death books geralt never see big injury depicted season happen books meet time time books pretty clear geralt major issues want discuss
159vsf3,jtj8emv,"In the books mages are immortal because of an elixer they take to stop the ageing process. Magic is supposed to make them healthier though in general so they may also naturally age slower and live longer. For example Neneke knew Geralt when he was a child and is still alive and kicking even though Geralt is supposed to be over 100 years old when he first meets Ciri. Priests aren't mages obviously but they do have magical abilities in the witcher world as do Druids. Another example of this is that Triss must be around 40 when she is first introduced but she isn't described as looking middle aged. Yet how can she have taken the elixer if she's allergic to potions? It's possible mages developed some other way of stopping the aging process, or Triss just ages slower. 

Mages don't get sterilised in return for beauty and immortality in the books. Instead magic just seems to naturally make mages sterile but not all the time and its implied Tissaia sterilises her students on purpose. We don't know if Visenna studied at aretuza.

I'm thinking they might blow right past a lot of it and get to the Wild Hunt game content in season 5, if we have a season 5. I hope Hemsworth does a good job because the show's not going to hold up without a good Geralt. Everyone is fine but he still anchors the show.

Same. I enjoyed the earlier seasons' helpings of bosom but I've also been enjoying the plot. I had more of a problem with them having Triss have brown hair in ssn 1 than I did any other casting decision. 🙃 

I have enjoyed the menace Phillipa has seemed to radiate (even as an owl for those that knew who she was) so I have had no problems with any of the castings at all. 

I'm not feeling that Cavill leaving ruined the show for me. I was going to watch it to whatever conclusion they give it (and any spinoffs they devise) because I -love- the -Witcher- universe, books, series and most recently the games as I got Witcher 3 for my nephew and started playing it too. I think It's great that he cares about the story and I agree that he did an -amazing- job with it. 

As for Liam, I'm with you, I'm going to withhold any judgement on him until I actually see what he is going to do with the role. I hope he does a good job because he has some hella big shoes to fill.

&#x200B;

But, the last year of literall social media war between 'books & games' and 'netflix show' fans has uncovered something. Right on this very sub, I read that Witcher books are not great.....not even very good....juts average fantasy, that wishes it could reach the greatness of ASoIaF.  Or that the Hussite trilogy by Sapkowski is superior (I promise I will read it some day).

&#x200B;

So I guess it's no surprise the watch party wasn't hooked.....turns out it was just 'average' all along..... My point is, the Witcher is not such a phenomena like the GoT was. IMO,  everyone was a fan of GoT because everyone arround them was. Me, I was just a teen at that time and we didn't even have HBO at home, so I never watched it when it was 'fresh'. Then a few years later, I tried to watch it and lost interest after Season 3 episode 3. Which is strange, since I love the Witcher I should've loved the GoT aswell....right? Well, that's not the case as you can see.

&#x200B;

Of course, that doesn't mean that this adaptation is good. It definately could've been much better. My point is, not everyone likes the same things as others.

14qslc1,jqp17hc,"1. Its just a poorly written side plot. They gave too much importance very early to Francesca and the elves and now they have to write a completely original story. She isn't suppose to be a rebel at this point, she should be at the banquet with everyone else as a high ranking mage. 

2. This is a plothole in the show. Yen doesn't notice her missing and Geralt just happens to be there when Ciri needs to be saved. Or Yennefer knows about Ciri running away to Geralt, she just doesn't go after her. It's a very sloppy mess. In the books Yen and Ciri knew where Geralt is (told by the banker) and Ciri leaves a note to Yennefer before she sneaks out saying she wants to see Geralt one more time before enlisting to Aretuza. Yen reads the letter and goes after Ciri. Geralt is staying at a farmhouse sees Ciri being chased by the hunt. Ciri is saved by Yennefer who just caught up to Ciri just in time and dispelled the hunt with a powerful spell.

3. So in the books you don't see the hunt at any point up until now (none of the wild hunt scenes from season 2 were in the books) but you got some snippets about it. The author in previous books sets them up as an inexplicable phenomenon. A cavalcade of spectral riders, riding through the skies and kidnapping people, making them join their ranks. In the books it was the first time we got to see the wild hunt so there it didnt serve the purpose to remind you but rather to show you that they actually exist and they want Ciri. The scene of them appearing was set up really nicely by the author. Ciri rode out in the night, a storm is approaching, her horse gets scared, she thinks she is lost, she slowly getting haunted by bad memories, Cintra, the kinght with the winged helmet, Shaerrawedd, etc. Just in general reading the scene you get this eerie feeling that something is hanging in the air, then the hunt appears. Their apperence felt appropriate and you get the first sign that the hunt will have a greater importance down the line.

edit: So another reason why the Ciri is missing/wild hunt attack scenes felt out of place was because in the books at this stage Yennefer and Geralt haven't seen each other for years, and Ciri haven't seen Geralt for months. The wild hunt attack scene was also served as a reunion that as a reader you wanted since a book and a half. This was the first time ever Geralt Yennefer and Ciri got to be together. In the show they've been just separated and reunited again like what after a few days?

As for 1, I have no idea? I guess they assume that Geralt and Yennefer have to be dead for them to have a chance with Ciri?

For 2, there is a line from Yen about Geralt getting Ciri so I don't think it's supposed to be that she just let Ciri run off and didn't care, but the show certainly makes it feel that way.

14qslc1,jqormz4,"1. Not the book plot at all
2. In the books Yen did go immediately after Ciri and lead the charge vs the Wild Hunt
3. Yes, this is the first time they show up in the books. It is never explained why on text but you can kind of extrapolate. Since the sack of Cintra Ciri had never been completely alone for long. So this might be the first time they could feel an opportunity might exist. May also be that they are watching around Gors Velen like everyone else and their dogs ;)  In the books they are not very capable in the Continent World. So what they can do is quite limited. In the books both Geralt and Yen have been fairly competent protecting Ciri up to this point in the story. And we do not know if the Wild Hunt ever showed up anywhere near Ciri immediately after the sack of Cintra. Book Ciri is a bit traumatized and never told exactly what happened till she got to the farmers where eventually Geralt found her. It´s a very strong possibility that Ciri´s location has remained a mystery to the Wild Hunt since the sack of Cintra.  


I kind of went in several possible directions regarding the Wild Hunt because its left open in the books.   
But really, the most likely scenario is that, like many other big players, they were aware that Ciri would show up at Gors Velen / Aretuza.",16,2023-07-05 05:20:17,141.33805555555554,book plot books yen go immediately ciri lead charge vs wild hunt yes first time show books never explained text kind extrapolate since sack cintra ciri never completely alone long might first time could feel opportunity might exist may also watching around gors velen like everyone else dogs books capable continent world quite limited books geralt yen fairly competent protecting ciri point story know wild hunt ever showed anywhere near ciri immediately sack cintra book ciri bit traumatized never told exactly happened till got farmers eventually geralt found strong possibility ciris location remained mystery wild hunt since sack cintra kind went several possible directions regarding wild hunt left open books really likely scenario like many big players aware ciri would show gors velen aretuza
14qslc1,jqqdvjd,"Im going with the series logic, which is sometime a mess, but compare it to the books or answer from it is just plain stupid at this point.  
1 Just like Rience, elves wanted to capture Ciri, not kill her. Probably joined the fight to quicly snatch Ciri in the chaos, but none of them anticipated that getting to Ciri wiil not be that easy, her training proved useful. And of course there was Yennefer and Geralt.  
2 She probably didnt know it, or she did, sensed it when Ciri call for Geralt trough her enchnaced talisman, which led Geralt to Ciri. The whole Ciri left Yen, from a techical standpoint: editing/pacing was badly handled, thats why its not clear.  
3 I dont think that the Widl Hunt appering was random or out of nowhere. Maybe they knew she was alone at the time without protection. Later in the next episode it is explained that ""the door was left open"", that's why they can now become materialized, i guess...

Not at all lol

Not only did she know Geralt was alive. She also knew Triss had been called to KM ;)

And she was royally pissed about it! Which you have the entire book ""Dear Friend"" letter to showcase how much she was pissed about the entire situation :)

Here, a link bellow to her famous reply letter:

And if you want to confirm how much she knows, you just have to go read her first Blood of Elves scene with Jaskier. In that dialogue, Yennefer hints that she is on top of a lot of things ;)

14qslc1,jqqgi4b,"> but in the show it works

It wasn't logical writing even from the shows point of view. For 2 episodes they tried to hammer in our heads that Yennefer is doing everything for Ciri. She promised Geralt she will keep her safe etc. And now we don't even see her being conflicted wheter she should go after Ciri or not. Just a passing comment to Triss that Geralt will bring her to Aretuza. She might have heard Ciri talking to the enchanted coin calling for Geralt but even then how does Geralt can hear that and how can he reply to Ciri? How can Yennefer be sure that Ciri can make the multiple days journey? How can she be sure that Geralt will find Ciri?

For everyone here to read, I quote: 

*Dear friend, your unexpected letter – which I received not quite three years after we last saw each other – has given me much joy. My joy is all the greater as various rumours have been circulating about your sudden and violent death. It is a good thing that you have decided to disclaim them by writing to me; it is a good thing, too, that you are doing so so soon. From your letter it appears that you have lived a peaceful, wonderfully boring life, devoid of all sensation. These days such a life is a real privilege, dear friend, and I am happy that you have managed to achieve it*.  
   
There is no reason to asume that she knew for all 3 years that Geralt was alive. I understand that at least for some considerable time she really thought him dead.",2,2023-07-05 20:49:02,156.81722222222223,great till point say yennefer thought geralt dead books lol everyone read quote dear friend unexpected letter received quite three years last saw given much joy joy greater various rumours circulating sudden violent death good thing decided disclaim writing good thing soon letter appears lived peaceful wonderfully boring life devoid sensation days life real privilege dear friend happy managed achieve reason asume knew years geralt alive understand least considerable time really thought dead

14t0eo1,jr03p6y,"This is a problem coming from poor adaptation. Not unlike many others.

It can be explained that in the books Ciri knew Geralt´s location and it was actually nearby. Which is also the reason why she decided to flee in the first place. Because she knows where to go and its near in the books ;)

Also, Book Yennefer did run after her!

The Wild Hunt did show up in the books too but it was Geralt + Yennefer vs them. And Yennefer can conjure some pretty bad ass spells.

Jaskier had just come to be with Geralt so he was indeed around. Once again, this is all possible because Geralt was pretty near the big city of Gors Velen. So everyone and their dogs kind of expected all of them to be around there.

The boat scene? Well....that exists in the books but it was copy pasted from a different point in the story lol And it was Geralt alone in that book scene. No Ciri and no Jaskier were there on the boat.

In short, the writers of this show are like a bunch of high school kids playing with Microsoft Word and copy paste function.

P.S.: As for the timeline in the books. Its not explicit because none says that she started going at 21h, arriving at 22h :) But given the events I would say her book ride took less than 1 hour.

14t0eo1,jrddhh9,"This is bugging the hell out of me too. I just finished ep. 3 and I've gone back twice thinking I missed something. The third time I just said fuck it, knowing this is apparently how they're choosing to do the story. There seems to be much more telling than showing this season. They'll just dump a scene on you and then fill you on what's going on later or have you intuit the rest.

The scene you're talking about, I was sure that was a dream or something. Between the bad cgi and the fact that Ciri was in the town with Yennefer but then she's racing away with a horse (where did she even get a horse?) but they never showed anything to suggest she left, plus shadowy wild hunt people, who last we saw were in/on a different shere, made my think it wasn't real. I also didn't think she'd be that fucking stupid,  although apparently I was giving her too much credit, especially since she's been doing stupid shit consistently this season. 

Then of course there's Geralt's deus ex machina moment. Which, ok, she called to him, but is that talisman basically a magical cell phone? They can apparently communicate, and it gives him her exact location? It's all just very convenient. Especially since he was supposedly a bit of a ways away. 

I'm also a bit frustrated with some of the lack of common sense. For instance, mages can create illusions. Why wouldn't Yennefer change their appearances? Or at the very least there has to be some kind of dye they can use on Ciri and Geralts hair, right? Even Yarpen mentions this but they don't bother. Hell they had Yen wear a mask to the festival but not Ciri or Geralt, cause that makes sense. Everyone and their mother wants Ciri but she has to keep drawing attention and wandering off. 

Yen and Ciri need a portal that can't be traced, so rather than have Ciri bleed a little to get the feainnewedd (or idk taking some before they left knowing they'd be hunted and might need to escape quickly and an untracable portal might come in handy) they do all this other shit. Why didn't Yennefer think of that? 

Geralt is so impatient to ask questions he damn near fucks the whole thing up and risks Teryn not remembering anything. Then he has a chat about his mother but doesn't bother to stick around a little longer to get the information he *actually needs*, which was the entire point. It was so important he risked his friends' lives but then left before actually finding out? 

I still have 2 (or 5 episodes I guess) left so I'm sure there will be more lol.",1,2023-07-10 13:00:13,269.0036111111111,bugging hell finished ep ive gone back twice thinking missed something third time said fuck knowing apparently theyre choosing story seems much telling showing season theyll dump scene fill whats going later intuit rest scene youre talking sure dream something bad cgi fact ciri town yennefer shes racing away horse even get horse never showed anything suggest left plus shadowy wild hunt people last saw inon different shere made think wasnt real also didnt think shed fucking stupid although apparently giving much credit especially since shes stupid shit consistently season course theres geralts deus ex machina moment ok called talisman basically magical cell phone apparently communicate gives exact location convenient especially since supposedly bit ways away im also bit frustrated lack common sense instance mages create illusions wouldnt yennefer change appearances least kind dye use ciri geralts hair right even yarpen mentions dont bother hell yen wear mask festival ciri geralt cause makes sense everyone mother wants ciri keep drawing attention wandering yen ciri need portal cant traced rather ciri bleed little get feainnewedd idk taking left knowing theyd hunted might need escape quickly untracable portal might come handy shit didnt yennefer think geralt impatient ask questions damn near fucks whole thing risks teryn remembering anything chat mother doesnt bother stick around little longer get information actually needs entire point important risked friends lives left actually finding still episodes guess left im sure lol
14t0eo1,jr0p3c3,Those time jumps only started to happen once they went off the source material and thought they could write a story as compelling and convincing and yet engaging to audiences. They had to do it because they ran out of source material. Lauren Hissrich went off source material because her and her team of writers think they can do a better job than the books.

I just take the time to explain people what was behind it.

Because there is a better story behind all this. And I think people can enjoy the series all they want. But there is a better story to explore for those who might be interested :)

You can go around all you want and you will never see me saying I hate the show. And never see me saying anyone should hate the show.

Which is part of the reason why I get so much karma.

I am just spreading love for the books. That the show managed to look bad in comparison is not really my doing.

I do notice that some show fans seem to get mad when I spread love for the books. But really....direct your anger somewhere else. Because its not because of me that the show makes you look bad when compared to the books. That´s not entirely my fault.

14tnakc,jr3hxb3,"I understand what you're saying but I don't think the Voleth Meir argument works because she never makes anyone do anything against their will.

Yennefer chooses to accept Voleth Meir's offer of her own free will. 

Not knowing Ciri doesn't hold up very well either because she didn't know Cahir personally either. She did know that he was a fanatical murderer who led the crusade against the North. But refused to execute him even though it would greatly benefit her because she doesn't want to be labeled a killer.
